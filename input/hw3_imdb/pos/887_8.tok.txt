i saw the movie on its north american premiere ( july 14 , 2004 ) at the fantasia festival .
i was slightly disappointed as i had been expecting a more epic , ensemble cast movie along the lines of musa the warrior .
instead , the movie concentrated only a much smaller number of characters .
still , the movie was solid , thoughtful and visually intriguing .
there were slightly jarring tone shifts from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties , intrigue and blood , versus the lighter , more flamboyant , martial arts sequences .
it almost seemed as though the filmmakers could n't make up their minds about whether the movie was supposed to be a martial arts `` flick '' or a historical epic .
the story touches nicely on the issue about the need for loyalty versus the need to adapt to new situations .
is it really worth your life and those of your friends to be loyal to one 's master or does there come a time when one must submit to the winds of change ?
is there perhaps greater courage in leaving the old ways for new ones ?
how does one decide ?
these questions are raised in this movie , and ironically , there is the suggestion that the answer given , may in fact be the wrong one !
