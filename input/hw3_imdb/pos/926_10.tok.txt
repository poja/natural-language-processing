master kieslowsky came with an idea in 1993 , the idea was to portrait how human relationship are in the world today , passing from blue ( a crafted visual masterpiece about a woman 's life ) from white ( a visual comedy movie about marriage ) and finally arriving to red ( a masterpiece dealing with human interaction ) .while i 'm not going to spoil the move i can easily say red is the best movie from the 90 's decade because it has one of the strongest messages in a script i have ever ever seen.the movie begins a little slow but finds it 's rhythm early enough to keep you hooked through the whole movie.the performances are perfect , sublime .
since the characters are completely realistic and they 're not clich√©d in any way and one could expect no less from the actors and one does n't get disappointed ... seriously i believe jean louis tringtignat deserved an oscar nod at least.the music from zbiegnew preisner is amazing it 's one of the best musical scores ever .
piotr sobocinsk cinematography is also outstanding he got an oscar nod for it ( and deserved to win ) .overall the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people that love foreign cinema and people who do n't .
do n't miss it.how did the awful pulp fiction beat ed this masterpiece at cannes is beyond my comprehension
