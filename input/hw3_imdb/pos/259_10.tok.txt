i watched love life on holiday , when it was filmed at a film festival in florida .
it was a lovely surprise to find a british film that was n't derivative or exploitive .
a beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film .
the transitions between scenes i found a bit distracting , but as whole i think love life is a winner , a ruby in the dust .
one for all the family .
a pleasant change to see a british film for teen audiences that is n't littered with four letter words .
try and see it .
