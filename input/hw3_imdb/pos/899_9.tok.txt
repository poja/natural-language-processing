i think this movie has got it all .
it has really cool music that i can never get out of my head .
it has cool looking characters .
is really funny ( you know , the kind that you 'll crack up on the ground and you 'll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks ) .despite the bad acting , bad cgi , and bad story ( about cops going after a robot ) , its really cool .
its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch , get together , eat pizza , laugh like crazy , and watch it two more times.there are so many funny parts , like when kurt was trying to get edison 's attention and gave him the finger , and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball .
on that part , i kept saying `` remember , remember ?
`` to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened .
there was also a really funny part when edision ran into the room and kurt was there ( just before they fought ) and kurt was talking about his `` strange dream '' and how he was `` superman '' .
i loved that part , although it has been a while since i saw it , so i do n't remember that part .
everything the actors said were funny , like how kurt says , `` i worship you , like a god ! ''
to the robot.although there was some bad things , in all it was a great movie .
man , i ca n't stop laughing .
i wish i had that movie . )
