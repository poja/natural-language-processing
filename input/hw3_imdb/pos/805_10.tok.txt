this is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'the hollow ' .
it could be argued that the actual mystery here is not one christie 's best but what makes 'the hollow ' special is the characterisation and i found the actors here , more or less without exception , were perfect in their parts .
in such a uniformly good cast it 's difficult to select stand out performances but i have to say that sarah miles is just perfect as lucy angkatell .
what is extraordinary is that she not only conveys lucy 's dottiness , tactlessness and her more lovable qualities but she also manages to pull off the underlying truth that in fact , lucy is not really all that nice !
megan dodds is also very good as henrietta and claire price very affecting as gerda .
john christow is really quite an unlikeable character but jonathan cake nevertheless manages to make us see what his women see in him.as i said , the script follows the story quite faithfully .
the only disconcerting thing i found was that midge and edward 's relationship really comes out of nowhere and i do believe that some of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor !
theirs a secondary story however and the primary story is very well done .
the whole thing looks beautiful as well , really capturing a perfect english autumn.its a beautiful film in every respect and well worth seeing .
