i caught the first screening of driving lessons at the tribeca film festival .
rupert grint shows he can act past harry potter .
laura linney is amazing as the overbearing mother .
julie walters is hilarious as dame evie walton , with a mouth worse than a sailor .
i hope that this film is picked up by an american distributor so that everyone can see it .
this film is not only about driving lessons , but life lessons .
ben ( rupert grint ) is torn between wanting to obey his overbearing mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life .
it 's an amazing film , from an amazing director whose taken his own life and put it on the screen for everyone to see , and everyone who can , should .
