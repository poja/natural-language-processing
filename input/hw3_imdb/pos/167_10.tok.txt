bloody birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters .
steven ( andy freeman ) , curtis ( billy jayne ; credited as billy jacoby ) , and debbie ( elizabeth hoy ) , were all born on the same day during an eclipse .
besides sharing a birthday , they also share a love of murder ( and they 're not picky about who they kill either ) .
young billy , elizabeth , and andy play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too .
but they ca n't go on fooling everyone .
this is an overall good horror flick , its not too unrealistic , there are a few good moments of suspense and the kids portrayed the roles well , ( the grown-ups are pretty hammy though ) .
i 'd say its well worth seeing , ( i own a copy myself ) .
