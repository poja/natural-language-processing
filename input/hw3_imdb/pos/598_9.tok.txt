the first feature length muppet movie , and excepting maybe the muppet christmas carol , the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide .
disney has done the muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over again .
featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos , keeps to a simple but original plot , classic muppet lame jokes , paul williams genius in song writing , and electric mayhem madness , and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets .
only croft has come close to hensen 's genius with puppets .
half of the fun today is playing is that cameo actor/actress still alive ?

i can only hope frank oz and dave goelz and the rest of the surviving muppeteers can somehow rescue and revive kermit and company from the deadly grasp of disney .
