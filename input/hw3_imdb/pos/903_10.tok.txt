this is a well done action movie .
there are plenty of fight scenes , the acting is convincing ( for this genre ) and rs1 is awesome .
i do n't know why people feel compelled to trash rs1 , i thought his effects were executed very nicely and his design looked great .
the plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie.having said that , i must tell you richard sun is one of the worst actors from hong kong i have ever watched .
at least rs1 had the right idea by killing him .
now , for all of you who thought sam lee ( alien ) was a bad actor ... he was n't meant to be taken seriously !
i have just had the pleasure of watching gen-x cops ( prequel ) and sam lee played the same character the same way !
now , please , all of you guys who watch highly reviewed oscar winners : do not judge this is a thinking man 's movie !
it is n't supposed to require thought !
just meant to be enjoyed , that 's all .
i hope they make another soon .
