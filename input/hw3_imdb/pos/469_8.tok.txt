this movie is like happiness meets lost in translation with a sixth sense ending ( or maybe a crying game surprise ) , and the best soundtrack i 've probably ever heard ... if that all make sense.the first 30 seconds pretty much tells you you 're in for a twisted ride .
( i was surprised no one walked out right away during the brooklyn premiere . )
but from there , the film settles down into a talk-fest between two really damaged people , daphne and buddy.they 're lonely , mess-up , and boy do they talk about sex .
daphne brings to life her most interesting tales of escorting , some are quite funny ( mr. chang ) some disturbing ( the harlan scenes with music that tells us what we see might now be what 's going on , or what daphne is really feeling ) , and because i have a friend who used to escort , i might add , most seem quite real .
you are alone is multi-layered and mostly brilliant .
okay , maybe a couple minutes less of the talking , and i do n't know that we 'd have missed anything .
then again , i need to see it again knowing the ending.i like this movie .
( the director asked people in the brooklyn audience to write a review on imdb because a lot of people read them .
request granted . )
