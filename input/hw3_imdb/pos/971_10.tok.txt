i love this movie .
yes , the main character lies , but that 's why it 's called `` big fat liar '' .
even though this kid runs away to hollywood , it does n't give kids the idea that they can .
besides , he does n't just do it for fun or to get away from anything , he does it to regain trust .
i do n't think it was just one big ad for universal studios , because i liked how it gave an inside view of what it 's like for kids who do n't know how cool movie-making is .
it has good music and fun characters .
this family/comedy is totally fun for kids and parents alike .
it has humour , excitement , and real life difficulties like lying.in the end , `` big fat liar '' sends out a moral : do n't expect lying to be easy .
