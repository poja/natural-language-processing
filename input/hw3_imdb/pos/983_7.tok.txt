okay , i 'll admit that if i did n't have kids , i never would have seen this film and would never see it .
but , considering all the rotten kids movies i have seen ( such as spy kids 2 or babe : pig in the city ) , this is a significant improvement .
and , it had enough in it that i was n't totally bored out of my skull or contemplated suicide ( something i did repeatedly in the other two movies ) .
sure , the performances are pretty broad and the plot is kinda silly -- but it is a kids film .
and , compared with other films in the genre , this is definitely better than average .
frankie muniz and amanda bines actually appear to have some talent and probably will continue to have careers after puberty -- at least on infomercials or doing voice-overs.so , if you are looking for a film to see with your kids , you certainly could do a lot worse !
