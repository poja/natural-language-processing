i really enjoyed this movie - i like prison movies in general ( i 'm not sure why -- i 'm sure some shrink could make something out of it ! )
i spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago , and i knew then i would never go back - i got the individual version of `` scared straight '' !
( i did get locked up in an isolation cell on alcatraz for a couple of hours , compliments of a park ranger , but that 's another story ! )
anyway , the genre really interests me .
the soundtrack , specifically `` sympathy for the devil '' by the rolling stones , was the perfect backdrop for the film .
to this day , i think of `` the jericho mile '' every time i hear the song .
