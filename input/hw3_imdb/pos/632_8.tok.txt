i do n't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.i saw this film on tv , i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film .
i missed the first , probably , 10 minutes , but that does not matter..this film literally gripped me , it is a real spine chiller.the absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect , u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new .
u never know when they will get killed or what they are up to .
so it is all the more tense.even though there are many new faces their performances were top class.the filmmakers play with your mind , just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest .
the shock , fear , horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the film.the well written situations n twists , fast camera movements , slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller .
this film actually switches between the genres - horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed .
undoubtedly comparable to hitchcock .
i could not even move from the tv even during the commercial breaks .. i was the helpless mute witness to this superb film .
