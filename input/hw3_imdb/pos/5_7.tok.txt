i only went to see this movie because i have always liked kevin costner .
i felt that ashton did a great job in the butterfly effect .
unfortunately , even though these two actors were/are capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here .
some of the scenes were just not believable and did n't have enough story line support.though the movie claims influence from the hurricane katrina aftermath , there was very little ( none ) to that effect in the movie.overall , i liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspective.the special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating .
not sure i 'll ever go deep sea fishing again ... i expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presented.definitely a movie that could 've been seen on dvd .
