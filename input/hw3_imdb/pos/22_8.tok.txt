what is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews i have read here , is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film .
while courtenay 's character is evidently gay , he is not the only one : the often talked about mr. davenport-scott is the other , and the reason that he is never seen , the reason alluded to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been detained by the police for homosexual activity - a criminal offense in england at the time.we can read under the surface that this recent event has unsettled norman , courtenay 's character : and we can also see in a passing remark by oxenby , the edward fox character , the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law is involved : the fear of association affects many of the characters , and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it .
the abandonment of courtenay at the end by sir has been anticipated all the way through , if this subtext is included : it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his dresser from the list of those he gives thanks to .
the flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that courtenay has to 'step into the footlights ' , as he does when he makes the announcement about the imminent air raids , a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous , but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the man 's inner torment.so while the drama is of the decline of finney 's sir , a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the 'fatal flaw ' of courtenay 's gayness , and makes this a film about him , as the title suggests.the art direction , pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time , more distant than the eighties and , in some ways , even than the second world war .
the implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order , and the sympathy of the character racked and ruined by the cruelties of that order , of necessity trapped in the enclosed world of the theatre ; and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant , for all its flaws .
