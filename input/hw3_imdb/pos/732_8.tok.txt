sweet young nurse charlotte beale ( a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout rosie holotik ) goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by dr. geraldine s. masters ( the excellent annabelle weenick ) .
among the motley assortment of colorfully crazed patients are insatiable , aggressive nymphomaniac allyson king ( the luscious betty chandler ) , loopy judge oliver w. cameron ( a gloriously hammy gene ross ) , paranoid vietnam veteran sergeant jaffee ( nicely played by hugh feagin ) , gentle giant sam ( the amiable william bill mcghee ) , and nutty old hag mrs. callingham ( the supremely irritating rhea macadams ) .
said patients are dangerously encouraged to act out their fantasies by dr. masters , which of course results in a rash of brutal killings .
director s.f .
brownrigg , working from a clever and suitably overwrought script by tim pope , does an expert job of creating and sustaining a suffocatingly dank and brooding atmosphere of seething madness and oppressive claustrophobia .
robert farrar 's spooky score , the grimy set design , a few wild grisly murders , bruce b. alcott 's grungy no-frills cinematography , plenty of deliciously robust , scenery-scarfing histrionics from a game no-name cast ( ross in particular is a total eye-rolling hoot ) , and the genuinely shocking surprise bloodbath conclusion further add to the overall infectiously seedy fun of this choice trashy chunk of 70 's low-budget regional horror exploitation cinema .
