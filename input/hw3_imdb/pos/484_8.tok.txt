i really enjoy this particular production of `` the mikado . ''
the producers added a few touches throughout to make it more amusing for modern audiences -- for instance , `` as some day it may happen '' ( the `` little list '' song ) is completely updated , and a few lines are ad-libbed throughout the play .
liberties were also taken with the setting .
the costumes are not japanese , but rather 1920s english ( although some of the `` tittipudlian '' girls wear '20s-inspired kimonos ) .
this production is well-choreographed with some 1920s dance styles , and there are some extra dancing maids and bellhops to keep your eyes ( as well as ears ) entertained during the songs .
if you 're a gilbert & sullivan purist these changes may bother you , but i think they 're fine -- and i love the costumes !
felicity palmer ( katisha ) is absolutely hilarious ; all of her scenes make me laugh out loud ( one of my favorite add-ons is when she first makes an entrance -- the dancing bellhops annoy her with their antics , so she screeches at the top of her voice , `` stop it !
!
! ''
) .
all of the other main characters do a fine job as well .
i particularly like mark richardson as pish-tush ( that toupee ! )
and lesley garrett as yum-yum.you must keep in mind that this is a stage production being filmed and set your expectations accordingly .
there is no change of setting , although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest .
if there is one draw-back to this production , it is that the stage makeup was n't modified for close-up shots with a camera .
foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner , lipstick , and blush everywhere .
i 've seen this sort of thing happen before with films of plays , and it 's a little jarring at first .
however , i hope you 'll get used to it and enjoy `` the mikado '' for what it 's worth -- a thoroughly enjoyable rendition of a classic !
