in a better civilization , this and many other of the david suchet movies would be released in theaters .
the plots are fabulous ( no , i 'd no clue who had done it , but the clues were all there if i 'd been more imaginative - the best kind of mystery ) , the production values astounding , the acting ( from edward fox , sarah miles , lysette anthony , megan dodds , and of course david suchet as hercule poirot ) simply perfect , the dialogue wonderful , the music and sens of suspense and tension just wonderful stuff.one of the pleasures of these hercule poirot movies for a man is how many beautiful women star in them !
here were have two - the sexy sinuous megan doods and the stunning lysette anthony.you really ca n't go wrong renting these - they 're just wonderful - like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind constantly working because it 's all there and you struggle but by keeping your mind constantly thinking can keep up with everything - and the settings gorgeous.i ca n't think of movies that stimulate thought more than these hercule poirot/david suchet movies .
it 's impossible to over-praise them - and i had never seen one before a few months ago nor read an agatha christie .
