this is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in florida and the subsiquent court case that follows .
what this film shows is how corrupt the american police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if he rots in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wife.the star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along .
fascinating stuff .
7 out of 10 .
