we are in a small town , a homely widow ( ida lupino ) hires a handyman ( robert ryan ) to look after her house .
she soon starts to regret it as ryan grows erratic by the hour , it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic , and now she is unable to escape her house.beware , my lovely is adapted from mel dinelli 's { the spiral staircase } story and play called `` the man '' .
pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece , the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness .
one however should n't be fooled into thinking this is a violent and nerve shredding picture , because it is n't .
it 's clear from the get go that ryan 's howard wilton is a dangerously troubled man , but this is a different sort of `` peril '' movie .
one that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist.ryan and lupino are a great combination , they had also done the excellent , and far better , on dangerous ground this same year .
so with both actors clearly comfortable together , it brings out a finely tuned character story all based in the confines of one house , re : prison .
ryan is particularly strong as his character flits in and out of madness , with some scenes powerful and at times inducing fear and at others garnering deep sympathy .
the direction from harry horner is safe { he in truth does n't have to do much other than let his actors run with it } and george e. diskant 's cinematography contains some smart and impacting visual touches .
with one involving christmas tree baubles immensely memorable .
falling some where in between being average and great , beware , my lovely has enough about it to make it a recommendation to fans of borderline and easy to follow film-noir .
for fans of robert ryan tho , it 's something of an essential viewing , oh yes , and then some .
