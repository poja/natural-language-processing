intense domestic suspense with the mistress of the house ( lupino , excellent as always ) threatened by a psychotic migrant housecleaner ( ryan ) .
the 2 masters of the genre are at their heady , erotic best as they match wits , emotions , and wills in a bizarre hostage situation right out of the saturday evening post .
richly hued b & w photography with an unusual amount of close-up head shots .
the young girl who teases ryan is really well directed here .
improbable , but satisfying suburban melodrama .
