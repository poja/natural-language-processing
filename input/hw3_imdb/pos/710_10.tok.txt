i love watching the jericho mile .
i mean watching peter strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt sprint the 100 meter .
i think peter strauss is a excellent actor and should do another running movie .
he is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing .
no man alive can out race rain murphy i mean the man runs 80 mile a week no one does that but him .
i 've watched the jericho mile 100 's of times and will watch it 100 's more .
great movies get watched more than movies that are not .
i thank the makers of this film for giving years of there lives to make it.they are great people and i bless them all.thank you for letting me get my word out again thank you all .
