as a big dostoyevsky fan , i had always been disappointed with hollywood 's halfhearted attempts to get into the russian romantic aesthetic -- case in point , yul brynner as dmitri karamazov .
i had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions , but then i saw yul as major surov and changed my mind .
when given an intelligent script to work with , he suddenly came alive and was as noble , sexy , and conflicted as you could ever want a neurotic russian officer to be !
so he was a better dmitri as major surov than he was as dmitri .
but that 's because writer tabori actually gave yul , as the conflicted russian officer , the kind of conflicted russian officer lines that are worthy of real literature , and that have real meaning and pathos in them .
for example , a propos of folk music , he says musingly , `` you hear a man crying in the dark .
and if you listen carefully enough , you know what he cries for .
you look surprised , lady ashmore .
despite what you may have heard , tractors and marxism are n't the only things the russian cares for .
there is always time for music. ''
brilliant !
