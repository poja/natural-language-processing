i saw this tonight with moderate expectations - if tartan films have picked up on something and are releasing it the that 's generally a good sign , however i 'm not normally a fan of julie walters , generally disliking her comedy roles ( sorry to any fans , but it 's a personal thing - i just do n't find her funny in comedy ) .this was magnificent though - a great performance by all , but grint and walters are exceptional !
plenty of laughs , plenty of pathos , great timing and a wonderfully paced film - such a coming of age film would n't normally be something i 'd expect to like so much but i ca n't recommend this highly enough - and watch rupert grint as he matures into a fine fine actor .
