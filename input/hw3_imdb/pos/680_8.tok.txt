i can see that the ratings for this film are n't all that high for this film , so i must be in the minority for liking this film so much .
well , i am right and everyone else is wrong ( just kidding ) .
i guess i like it because i am a psychology teacher and i really liked the brooding character played by ryan .
while he truly is dangerous as well as very menacing , you ca n't exactly hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some sort of brain trauma .
and wow did ryan do a really good job portraying this man !
you really find yourself feeling for ida lupino as he destroys her life .
so with such intense acting and menace , why is the movie rated relatively low ?
well , probably because it is n't exactly believable , ... but boy is it entertaining and creative .
give it a try and do n't believe the score of 6.4 -- it 's a lot better than that !
