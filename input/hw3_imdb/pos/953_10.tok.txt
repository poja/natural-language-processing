brilliant screenplay..the screenplay is very tight ..that u will be gelled in seat..this movie is an example for movie can survive only with screenplay and no-story needed..story is very simple that u can write in one line .
but screenplay was amazing..brilliant performance by vijay and prakashraj..though plot is similar to okkadu.. director adapted only the plot .
tamil version is much fast paced than telugu.movie travels straight without any chance of deviation , though u can understand each and every characters back-drop.keep going
