having just seen walt disney 's the skeleton dance on the saturday morning blog as linked from youtube , i used those same sources to watch a remake done in technicolor for the columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man-ub iwerks .
the colors , compared to the earlier black and white , are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one 's off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone-are just as funny as the previous short .
it does get a little repetitious near the end .
still , skeleton frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier silly symphony .
