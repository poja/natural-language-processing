do n't look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and bad acting .
sure , it 's not a masterpiece by anyone 's standards but it is a very fun little b-film with a lot to offer and even a lot of creepy scenes that will stay in your head.as i said , the acting could have been a lot better but that 's the case with most exploitation so i ca n't really complain .
the story is clever and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing .
i thought the gore was a lot of fun too .
there 's just something great about older gore films because they did n't have cgi back then so they had to actually set it all up themselves .
see this one for a good time !
