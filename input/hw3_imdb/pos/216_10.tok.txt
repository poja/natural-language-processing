the inspiration for the `` naked gun '' movies casts leslie nielsen - who had only recently started doing comedy* - as the incompetent but heroic frank drebin , always having to solve an absurd case .
like `` airplane ! ''
and the movies based on the series , the humor relies on mel brooks-style spot gags and silly comments ( namely the `` yes it is '' remarks ) , along with the fact that nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him .
and of course , the final frame , in which something keeps moving.it 's too bad that the show only had six episodes .
at least it spawned the movies .
you ca n't go wrong with leslie nielsen in these sorts of roles .
i suspect that they all had fun filming it .
really funny .
*before `` airplane !
`` , leslie nielsen had starred in movies like `` forbidden planet '' , `` harlow '' and `` the poseidon adventure '' .
as late as 1987 he co-starred in `` nuts '' alongside barbra streisand and richard dreyfuss .
but since the first `` naked gun '' movie it 's been all comedy all the time .
