while watching this film recently , i constantly had to remind myself that it was made in 1957 ... ... ... .and in the ussr !
that makes it all the more remarkable .
many of the cinematographic effects in the film seem cliched in 2002 , but they were quite original in 1957. i first saw this film in 1963 , when it was first released in the us , and i was struck by its originality then .
now just having seen it 40 years later , i have no reason to change my mind .
