i have seen this movie when it was released and no doubt it is heart touching .
i liked the point of view of a kid who came to know that what she was thinking about her were actually not true .
it 's a shatter to that small kid .
and her search to find out who she is .
and before and after she knows about her , the relationship between her and her foster-mom .
that 's a nice view .
a r rahman adds his stress by a good re-recording and songs .
in this movie mani ratnam does not exaggerate or give advices ( like in vuyire ) but simply narrates the characters as they are .
and because of that the film exactly strikes the audience .
the pool bath scene of chakkarvarthy and nandhitadas did not convey perfectly what it meant for .
mani ratnam has amazingly improved .
