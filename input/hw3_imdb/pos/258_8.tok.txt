logged on to the imdb to say what a charming film love love is and am totally confused .
seems to me that someone has been getting their titles mixed up .
`` plastic demon baby '' what ?
this was n't love life .
a little bit luvy dovey for my tastes but a great , funny and original film .
especially liked the ending that did n't fall into the normal pit of cliche that all hollywood romantic films crash and burn it .
nine out of ten .
