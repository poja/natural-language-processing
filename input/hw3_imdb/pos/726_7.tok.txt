what can i say ?
not as bad as many here have made it out to be .
the only reason i even watched this film that i had previously never heard of before , was strictly for ian mcshane.i was not disappointed in the least .
ian mcshane was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role .
he 's always great to watch and for my money ... an extremely underused actor.as for the rest of the film ... .
every other actor in the movie delivered strong , solid performances .
these people certainly were n't being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation ( as this was a fairly low budget film ) but this did not mean that any of them `` mailed '' their appearances in .
everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them.i was even pleasantly surprised at adrian paul 's performance though i must admit i have only ever seen him in the highlander television series before this movie.the plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life , not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film .
anybody who expected a clear-cut , by-the-numbers , connect the dots `` conclusion '' or `` answer '' at the end of the movie ... clearly was n't watching the film closely enough !
this film is not going to tell you what the `` meaning of life '' is !
the idea is that after seeing the film , you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee .
i certainly did.no car chases ... no explosions ... no bar room brawls ... .
( sounds pretty dull , huh ? )
but the reality is that i was completely absorbed by the film and it 's just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved .
****** warning ... ****** if you 're the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous `` question '' as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly ... you might not enjoy this film .
