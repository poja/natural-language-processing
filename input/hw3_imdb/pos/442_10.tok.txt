this is my favorite renoir from the fifties .
it 's the story of how henri danglard built and launched the moulin rouge nightclub ; we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway , and the training of the dancers .
finally , the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing .
financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described.gabin is in great form as the easy-going danglard -- see him deal humorously with nini 's violent boyfriend .
gianni esposito is moving as the wistful prince who is courting nini .
maria felix , with that amazon 's body , is imposing as the egotistical lola , danglard 's first lover .
finally françoise arnoul as nini the washing girl who ends up dancing for danglard , and becoming his girl , is just stunning ; her loveliness and pert charm will win you over.a bonus : we get edith piaf , patachou , andré claveau and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the moulin rouge .
