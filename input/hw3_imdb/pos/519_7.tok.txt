`` witchery '' is a decent little euro-trash horror yarn !
david hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly , he 's one of the better actors .
linda blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays hoff 's wife ... she is hilariously bad !
the plot of this film is ridiculous too .
it 's got some holes , which you ca n't help but notice , but it remains entertaining throughout.the gore in `` witchery '' is freaking outstanding .
i loved the part where the old bag gets `` sucked '' into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast !
and the part where the lady `` gets taken advantage of '' by the devil was pretty damned disturbing .
i 'd say this one is a must for gorehounds.if you 're looking for an overproduced , well-acted flick , look elsewhere .
but if you like old-school style italian sleaze and over the top gore , `` witchery '' belongs on your shelf.i 'm surprised by the low rating on here !
what were you people expecting , `` the exorcist ? ''
7 out of 10 , kids .
