i enjoyed the acting in this movie .
except for the sister .
she reminded me of janice on friends .
i could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious .
my main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother-in-law .
the guy falling out of the exploding car ?
maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital , maybe then i could have gone for the ending .
i think somebody needed to die in the execution scene .
mainly the brother-in-law .
he was such a pain in the ass anyway .
or maybe the sister needed to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute .
i could have even bought into the brother-in-law killing the hero and the ending being the two sisters being put in snuff films .
it is worth watching again and as i always say , it is much easier to be a reviewer instead of an author .
