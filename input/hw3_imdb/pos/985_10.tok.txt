for a tv movie this was definately worth seeing .
all the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme .
i have not read/seen the original and as a rule i ca n't stand shakespeare , but i enjoyed this movie ( the civil war setting was very well done as well ) .
dont expect to see an epic , however you should find it moving enough to enjoy .
by the way ( on a side note ) do n't compare this ( or any other movie for that matter ) to the original work .
movies are n't supposed to transfer a book to the screen , but rather take the general idea of it a then adapt a story from it .
when people say `` the book was so much better '' ( they 're usually wrong anyway ) what they are really trying to say is the book was so different .
