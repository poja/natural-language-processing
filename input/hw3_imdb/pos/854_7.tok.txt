this was a surprisingly very good movie , and an interesting idea.. however , it was just a little bit disappointing in that the 'twist ' was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie .
whilst watching , it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that , the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist , but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow .
there were superb performances , there was never a dull boring moment , so totally well worth watching this one .
it kept me interested right up until the end , and for me there is n't many movies that can do that these days .
i highly recommend people watch this terrific little movie .
