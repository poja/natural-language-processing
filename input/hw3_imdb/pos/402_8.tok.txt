better than average world war ii-era `` who-dun-it '' featuring warner baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as robert ordway who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight .
crime doctor 's courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems .
the link to `` courage '' is not particularly clear.this entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter gordon carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but dr. ordway labels murder .
hillary brooke plays the part of widow kathleen carson who is involved with anthony caruso - a mysterious spanish dancer whose act includes his sister that disappears on stage .
as a mystery novelist , jerome cowan is a good supporting actor as is lloyd corrigan as an aficionado in crime.spooky houses with creaking doors , caskets in the cellar , and suspects that are never seen in daylight add to the air of suspense .
the set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good .
direction , production design , and photography stand out .
the exterior shots and costumes suggest more affluence rather than normally found in the average `` b '' detective thriller.strongly recommended .
