i honestly do n't know what words imdb will allow me to use in this review , as a result , i 'm having a hard time describing these shorts .
let 's just say there 's a good amount of gay sex , some necrophilia , some incest , a fair amount of masturbation , and several artificial ... .
members .
and i loved every minute of it.not that it 's all crude humor .
it is n't .
they stray away from fart gags for the most part , with the exception of one sketch entitled `` pizza '' in which they use one very well .
`` they '' being 3/11ths of the short-lived sketch comedy group that aired on mtv called the state , namely david wain , michael showalter , and michael ian black.the trio go on adventures , usually playing themselves and encounter strange and unusual people , people that are often actually more normal than they are .
the supporting cast is fantastic as well .
paul rudd , julie bowen , bradley cooper , zach galifianakis , and sam rockwell all make appearances in various sketches .
they 're also joined by other the state alums like joe lo truglio and todd holoubek .
the musical selections are also very well placed.i 've enjoyed these sketches over and over again , but they are n't for everybody as they 're pretty vulgar most of the time .
if you like clever humor that is n't afraid to push the limits of good taste , then i highly recommend this .
if you liked wet hot american summer ( directed and written by wain and showalter ) or the state , then you should really enjoy this.i think it can currently only be ordered online .
check out their website and stream a couple of sketches to get an idea if you really want this first , and then find out how to buy the dvd .
