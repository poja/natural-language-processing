robert mckimson 's 'acrobatty bunny ' is one of the director 's finest shorts .
although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of mckimson 's dreadful 'big top bunny ' , 'acrobatty bunny ' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty .
pitting bugs bunny against a ferocious lion , 'acrobatty bunny ' is fresh and funny from the outset , not to mention extremely attractive to look at .
there 's a classic scene in which bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion .
in a brilliant disney parody , he hollers `` pinocchio '' down the lion 's throat !
this brilliant opening is a sign of things to come .
there are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion 's cage to begin with , followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of 'laugh clown laugh ' which , as a child , i used to impersonate regularly !
all this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name .
i 've never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but 'acrobatty bunny ' breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst mckimson 's best .
