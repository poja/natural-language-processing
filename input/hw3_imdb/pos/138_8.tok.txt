although at times i was the only one in the cinema who was laughing , this is the main pleasure i took from the beautifully shot `` thirst '' - laughter .
although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and did n't know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy , the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals .
it helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful , and that i was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady , who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she became.i read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong .
i did n't think so .
in fact the last scenes , moving and hilarious ( i mean , the brown shoes ... . )
by turns , were among the best in the film .
