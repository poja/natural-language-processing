glenn ford is hired by a crooked bank owner and wily stable owner edger buchanan to stage a fake robbery while the banker hides the real loot .
with ford a no-show , the two instead go with a trigger happy second choice , leaving ford on the hook for killings he did n't commit.columbia pictures ' first color feature , the desperadoes looks fantastic with sets and costumes fabricated to take full advantage of the technicolor process accentuating tons of well staged western spectacle.this has the irresistible teaming of a young glenn ford ( third-billed but essentially the star ) and a prime randolph scott leading an incredible supporting cast of great character actors in colorful roles , including scene-stealer edger buchanan as a good-natured but mildly villainous yokel who is n't as dumb as he looks and who has quite a few memorable lines.a fairly complex script effectively mixes incredible action sequences , melodrama , and comedy , well directed by charles vidor .
this is one of the great westerns of the nineteen-forties and highly recommended .
