i felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for eleanor bergstein .
the primary actors ( campbell scott , jennifer beals , yancy butler , james goodwin iii , patrick stewart , and leslie caron ) were very well selected and played their parts with excellence .
it was a very uplifting movie that i wish was available on tape or dvd .
a rare gem .
