i 'm pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it ca n't be accused of unfair bias .
with absolutely no cause , the jacksonville cops rush to judgment in this case and pick the first black suspect to accuse of the murder of a white , foreign tourist .
they picked a 15 yr. old kid who is just about as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then make fools of themselves trying to pin an unlikely case against him .
in addition to the unfairness resulting from the blatant prejudice there is the matter of 6 months of unjust imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager .
it makes one question whether as a society we should compensate those who are charged , imprisoned and subsequently found innocent .
this docudrama is well produced , professionally recorded and presented in a captivating package from which you wo n't want to take a 1 minute break .
if you care about social justice , do n't miss this one .
it certainly deserved its oscar .
