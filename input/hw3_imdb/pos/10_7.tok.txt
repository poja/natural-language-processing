if you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film , i would have told you it was great !
however , i left the theatre feeling unsatisfied .
after thinking a little about it , i believe the problem was the pace of the ending .
i feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow , and then the ending developed very fast .
so , i would say the ending left me disappointed.i thought that the characters were well developed .
costner and kutcher both portrayed their roles very well .
yes !
ashton kutcher can act !
also , the different relationships between the characters seemed very real .
furthermore , i thought that the different plot lines were well developed .
overall , it was a good movie and i would recommend seeing it.in conclusion : good characters , great plot , poorly written/edited ending .
still , go see it !
