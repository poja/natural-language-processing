this film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible , and her sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing adolescent turmoils .
`` anywhere but here '' is an engaging film from beginning to the end .
both ann and adele are described well right at the start , so we get to know how different their personalities are .
clashes inevitably ensue , and they are engagingly presented .
i find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances .
it is as if i am living their lives , feeling what they are feeling.susan sarandon gives another excellent performance in `` anywhere but here '' .
she is charismatic , happy go lucky , hedonistic , warm and loving all at once .
i have always liked susan sarandon , and i think she is grossly underrated .
`` anywhere but here '' is a captivating emotional journey .
