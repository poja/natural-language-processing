red skelton plays a radio detective known as `` the fox '' in `` whistling in the dark , '' also starring ann rutherford , conrad veidt , eve arden , virgina grey and rags ragland .
wally benton , aka `` the fox '' finds his plans to marry his fiancé carol ( rutherford ) thwarted when he 's kidnapped by a the leader of a sham cult ( veidt ) .
joseph jones ( veidt ) has just learned that his cult , the silver haven , is not getting a promised inheritance because of the existence of the old woman 's nephew , who is going to be living off of the interest .
he wants wally to devise a perfect murder plot so the man can be killed on the airplane en route to meet with his attorney .
for backup , and because he 's not sure which one is wally 's fiancé , jones kidnaps carol and also the radio sponsor 's daughter ( grey ) .this , to me anyway , is a superior film to the second entry in this series , `` whistling in dixie . ''
the plot is better , the cast is better , there is less slapstick and fewer corny jokes .
skelton , when he 's not making faces and rolling his eyes , is quite amiable , and rutherford is very good .
veidt always played these evil men to perfection .
eve arden is wally 's agent , who arranges a date for him and grey to make sure his contract is renewed .
i had only seen grey in films from the 1950s onward .
she was always a good-looking woman , but who knew she was such a knockout in the '30s and '40s ?
this is a fun film with a neat cast .
