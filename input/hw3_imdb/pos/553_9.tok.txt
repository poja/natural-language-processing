the interaction between portman and sarandon was quite interesting , and i was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship .
it is a family story that is n't dulled down by frills and special effects ; a story of how it really is .
i could n't help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends .
the acting was quite exquisite and i hope we 'll be seeing both portman and sarandon in familiar roles down the road ...
