just saw baby blue marine again after 30 years .
i still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever .
the innocence and purity of a time now long gone , is truthfully captured in this small film .
the acting is above average and richard gere 's brief appearance as a shell-shocked raider marine war hero , holds a keen interest for any film buff or gere fan .
jan-micheal vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the `` all-american '' boy .
the late bruno kirby ( who was billed as b.kirby , jr. ) has a meaty role as `` pop '' , a peace-loving , marine corp reject , dreaming of getting back home to his wife .
if you 're looking for sex , drugs , or rock and roll , this movie is not for you .
if you 're looking for action and adventure , the same applies .
however , if you want to recapture a time in america of innocence , honor , romance , and love , then baby blue marine is a movie for you .
