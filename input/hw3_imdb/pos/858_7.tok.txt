when i saw this movie the first thing that jumped at me was the acting of kelly overton a young ( and op and coming star ) actress that i saw for the first time totally blew me away.. she is amazing on screen and i 'm really looking forward to see what the future brings her ... .the movie it self was good in the sense that it let kelly overton do her stuff and take the wiever for a ride ... not much new tho i had the feeling that i had seen it all before.. but a good experience : ) i would recommend this movie ... if only to see kelly overton.. this stage actor takes the screen by storm.. i give this movie a vote of 7 ... 5 for the acting performance and 2 for the rest of the movie.and on a last note.. sorry about my bad english.. if this is gibberish for you : p plz ignore me ...
