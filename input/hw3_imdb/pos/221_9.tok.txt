police squad !
( 1982 ) was a funny show that ended too soon .
but i guess it had it 's run before it got too repetitive and unfunny like so many american television shows .
the geniuses behind this funny show were the team of zucker , abrahams and zucker .
every since his straight act in the comedy hit airplane !
, leslie nielsen has found a new career as a comedian .
in this short lived t.v .
series he had the chance to play the straight man in a wacky comedy once more .
the bizarre titles to each episode gave away the ending .
but lt. drebrin ( leslie nielsen ) got into so many weird cases that they have to be seen to be believed.tooo bad they never released this on d.v.d .
if a show needed to be re-released it would have to be this one .
a whole new generation is waiting to see this show !
highly recommended !
