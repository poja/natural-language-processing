there are 3 of these movies , all similarly crafted and each extremely amusing .
red plays radio sleuth wally benton , aka the fox who gets wrangled into solving real life crimes along with his fiance played by your typical wartime girl next door looker , ann rutherford .
many of the one-liners and gags are dumb and probably were in the 1940s which i anticipated .
but , just as many actually made me laugh out loud , which was unexpected to say the least .
red skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence , surprising i say because i grew up with a much older version of the man who 's charm really didnt play well in my formidable years .
i have to give these movies the go ahead though -if your in the mood for this type of nostalgic fare .
i almost threw in light hearted , but in truth people get wasted and beaten up and dare i say it , the suspense at times is well above average .
as with most movies from this era , it gets a pi ( politically incorrect ) rating for reasons you can well imagine .
wartime is funny that way i guess , and so then again are these movies .
watch one , watch them all .
