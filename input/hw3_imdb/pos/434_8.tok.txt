like classic hollywood musicals , the plot is just an excuse .
a must see for those interested in french music hall ( including a song by Ã©dith piaf ) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale .
the dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan.some might object to the technicolor costumes and the bright lighting , but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets.consider it jean renoir 's love letter to the paris he grew up in .
certainly the jean renoir film for people who do n't like his serious films or who only like his hollywood productions .
