jennifer montgomery 's `` art for teachers of children '' is a stunning , disturbing masterpiece .
montgomery 's gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking , raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old jennifer 's seduction of her married boarding-school guidance counselor .
the scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing jennifer ( caitlin grace mcdonnell ) and jennifer 's mother ( actually voiced by ruth montgomery ) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful i 've ever seen captured on film .
the lesson ultimately learned here ?
`` there 's nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art . ''
well , i would highly recommend this remarkable piece of `` art '' for anyone interested in thought-provoking independent cinema .
