in my analysis of `` trois couleurs : blanc '' i wrote that its tone is much lighter than the tone of `` trois couleurs : bleu '' .
i think it 's the same with this film .
this time it 's not because of a tragic comedy-element , but much more because of the main character valentine .
although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous , she manages her life with lightness and optimism , it seems to me that she might be kieslowski 's image for a carefree youth .
the opposite seems to be the judge , who is very pessimistic , a grumpy old man , who experiences big loneliness .
in my view , valentine and the judge are pretty similar to each other , the judge is just much older and has experienced many more disappointments .
they share a different kind of naivety and they both discover that they can learn much from the other one .
finally i would like to stress ir√®ne jacob 's performance , she rounds off the run of amazing female contributions to the `` three colours '' -trilogy .
