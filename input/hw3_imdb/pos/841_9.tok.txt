`` female convict scorpion - beast stable '' , the third in the series , is a magnificent piece of pulp sleaze .
closer in tone and subject to a nikkatsu violent pinker than other scorpion entries , it is stunningly photographed , directed with lurid enthusiasm , and populated with a rogue 's gallery of villains and degenerates .
shinya ito , the director of the first installment , returns for this surreal fable which begins with scorpion ( meiko kaji ) cutting the arm off a cop she is handcuffed to and fleeing into the tokyo subway with said arm still swinging from her wrist .
she takes refuge in a red light district where she befriends a prostitute , who is first seen seen having incestuous intercourse with her brother ( who ends up impregnating her ) .
scorpion 's desire to protect this unfortunate woman eventually exposes her identity and all hell breaks loose .
she is beaten , sexually assaulted , and locked inside a bizarre bird cage in the villain 's lair .
i loved everything about this hypnotic , nihilistic , and emotionally touching movie .
it is the superior of the three first scorpion films and features one great scene after another .
i ca n't recommend it highly enough .
