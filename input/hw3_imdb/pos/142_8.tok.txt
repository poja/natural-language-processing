we all know what chan-wook park can do .
if you have n't seen oldboy ( or the sympathy trilogy for that matter ) you are missing out on some of the best films made this century .
but i 'm not here to talk about them .
i 'm here to talk about thirst.this movie is not what you would expect .
yes it is a vampire movie , but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl .
i wont get into the synopsis ( you can read that above ) but instead tell you what this movie has to offer .
chan-wook park is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception .
with some very surreal scenes backed by intense lighting , he sets the mood perfectly in almost every scene .
the movie does start a bit slow , but i felt this was necessary to build a relationship with the characters .
once things start moving along it almost never lets up until the credits roll .
`` thirst '' is predominantly a love story , but not in the same sense that you would think .
the relationship between the lead characters is very intense , but at the same time almost disturbing .
chan-wook park is no stranger to controversy as we know , and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy .
the end scene is by far the most powerful in the movie , and perhaps one of the best conclusions to a film i have seen.overall this is an exceptional film that i feel all movie buffs should see .
it is an exciting ( and admittedly different ) take on the world of vampires , and the romance is far from sappy or boring .
this movie is gritty , selfless , and beautiful in all the wrong ways .
obviously it is not for everyone , but chances are if you are reading this review you are already interested .
see it .
do not hesitate
