has aged really well - still thrilling and suspenseful today .
certainly one of hitch 's best movies .
beautifully shot , with a great premise for suspense , sex-appeal provided by beautiful ruth roman .
because of the great premise , you feel like you have to watch it to the end .
if you find yourself losing faith in hitch and doubting his title as the master of suspense , i recommend this nice little movie as an antidote .
5 out of 5 .
