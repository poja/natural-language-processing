i 'm sorry , but `` star wars episode 1 '' did not do any justice to natalie portman 's talent ( and undeniable cuteness ) .
she was entirely underused as queen amidala , and when she was used , her makeup was frighteningly terrible .
for `` anywhere but here , '' she sheds her god-awful makeup and she acts normally .
and not only can she act good , she looks good doing it .
i 'm a bit older than she ( she 's only 18 ) , and i have little or no chance of meeting her , but hey , a guy is allowed to dream , right ?
even though susan sarandon does take a good turn in this movie , the film belongs entirely to portman .
i 've been a watcher of portman 's since `` beautiful girls '' ( where she was younger , but just as cute ) .
there 's big things for her in the future - i can see it .
