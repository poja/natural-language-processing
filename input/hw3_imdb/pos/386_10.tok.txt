`` strangers on a train '' was one of those film classics i had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing .
i finally watched it a few weeks ago and , as always with any hitchcock movie , it not only stood up to the test of time , it far surpassed most thrillers being made today .
you can see the inspiration for future action movies here - the climactic ending with the out-of-control merry-go-round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of jan de bont 's `` speed . ''
of course , `` strangers '' is over forty years older than `` speed '' and contains no modern special effects , but the visceral thrill is there - hitchcock was a true genius.the not-so-subtle gay side of bruno ( robert walker in an amazing performance ) has taken form in many other psycho-stalker-figures in future movies .
consider him a male version of jennifer jason leigh in `` single white female . ''
he knows about guy before he even meets him on the train - we almost get the feeling their contact is n't incidental - and is soon entirely obsessed with him.hitchcock loved the oedipial elements in his movies ( also see `` psycho '' for more blatant undertones ) and there 's a lot of that here .
bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother .
his effeminate ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by the censors in 1951 , when gays were not `` allowed '' to be portrayed on the screen - yet hitchcock gets the message through effectively when we see bruno in the lounge on the telephone wearing a very non-masculine robe , flirting with guy and responding to his mother.the deep layers of this movie make it a fast-paced thriller than you can return to again and again - unfortunately it 's being remade as a big-budget hollywood production , but after seeing the original i honestly ca n't imagine anything surpassing the sheer white-knuckle thrills of this movie .
