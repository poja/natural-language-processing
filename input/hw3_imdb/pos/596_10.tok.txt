i have not seen this movie since 1979 when i was a teenager .
i grew up with the sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life .
jim hensen was a genius and master muppeteer .
when i watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when i was younger and things seemed so much simpler .
for this bit of time travel i rate this movie a 10.the plot line explores how kermit goes from the swamp to hollywood .
the laughs and gags are classic muppetism .
i am glad these films are still around for the next generation .
i hope i never out grow the magic of the muppets .
