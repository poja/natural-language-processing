the real life case of an innocent first nations chief ( the indian ) by an winnipeg city officer ( the cowboy ) is the basis of this tv movie .
the actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in canada , a small scale martin luther king thing .
the misjustice of first nations people is becoming a staple in the canadian cinema diet .
what makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the family 's reactions .
the father played by gordon tootoosis demands forgiveness and the brother played by eric schweig demands justice .
the stars gordon tootoosis and adam beach ( windtalkers , skinwalkers ) have minor , almost cameo , appearances .
soon-to-be star eric schweig makes his mark in this film with a powerful performance .
an honourable mention goes to veteran actor gary chalk who has chalked up over 100 movies to his credit .
his portrayal of the troubled soul inspector dowson was worthy of a gemini award ( the canadian emmy ) along with eric schweig .
the special effects ( jump cuts , dream sequences ) are occasional and not overbearing .
couple this with some beautiful northern canadian scenery and recent ongoing events involving police officers and first nations people like the neil stonechild case , and you have a very rewarding and relevant viewing experience .
