i watch lackawanna blues every time it comes on .
it brings back happy times for me .
i grow up in a big city in the mid-west .
it reminds me of when i was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same .
it makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost .
the big mama 's of day are under the age of 55. will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other .
i hope that i was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past .
the music was great in this movie .
i truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters i would have paid to see it .
as i viewed the movie for the second time i figured out who life this movie was about .
he did an superb job in writing and producing this film .
i guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you .
as soon as i can i will be obtaining a copy for my home use .
i alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than .
thanks for such a great movie .
