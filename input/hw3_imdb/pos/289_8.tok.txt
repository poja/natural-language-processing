i have to admit that i had low expectations for this movie .
but i was surprised to find it entertaining , interesting , and funny .
it 's an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror film .
there were moments that made my hairs stand up !
even better , though , were the highly amusing , occasionally hysterical , comedic moments in the film ( you 'll know which ones i 'm talking about ) .
there also are a few great special effects ( and the humor and the special effects are n't necessarily separate ) .the acting , on the whole , is very good -- way better than a typical low budget horror film .
the lead ( jackie ) , in particular , and many of the smaller , supporting roles ( like the lawyer , the couple living next door , the pizza man ) are well acted .
if they had n't been , the film would n't have kept my interest and i would have lost my belief in the story .
this is a good , interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth a rental !
