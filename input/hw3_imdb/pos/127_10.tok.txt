previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the film 's plot details than i could .
what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful , in every sense - emotionally , visually , editorially - just gorgeous.if you like movies that are wonderful to look at , and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant , i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art.on a scale of 1 to 10 , i 'd give it about an 8.75. the only reason i shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece .
if you are in the mood for a really artistic , very romantic film , then it 's a 10. i definitely think it 's a must-see , but none of us can be in that mood all the time , so , overall , 8.75 .
