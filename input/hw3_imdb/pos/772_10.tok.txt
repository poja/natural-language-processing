a beautiful film .
one that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed .
made me think about death but not fear it , think about life but not hide from it .
a movie that gave both love for all i stand for and at the same time condemned it to the deepest pits of hell .
a movie that made me think of love and all that i have lost , but no sadness graced my eyes , for some strange reason , relief .
a child of two worlds , god and theater .
and a good bit of wine and irony !
i most highly recommend ***** '' when the s*** hits the fan , get a tent '' oh and we should all go camping .
every day .
