i remember watching police squad !
when it first came on abc in 1982 and i thought it was a very funny show , thanks to the many sight gags , non sequitors and scripts filled with word play .
in one episode , there was a line where a man named once was shot twice .
but unfortunately , abc canceled the show after only six episodes .
i felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode .
one that i remember was in the opening where the episode 's title was different from the one shown on the screen .
leslie nielsen 's portrayal of frank drebin was deadpan , yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of jack webb of dragnet .
alan north did well and peter lupus , in one of his few roles since mission : impossible was n't bad as norberg , but the one character that stood out was johnny the shoeshine boy , played by william duell .
after giving advice to drebin , there were cameos from dick clark , dr. joyce brothers and then dodger manager tommy lasorda .
even though police squad !
had a short life on abc , the zucker brothers did n't give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the naked gun movie franchise .
i 'll close with a regular closing gag .
freeze the ending right here .
