this movie deserves a 20/10 if i could give one .
`` the hollow '' is a great hercule poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people .
i am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel .
there was no major difference that i could spot .
the only difference was that poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel .
the acting was superb , and the music , as usual , was amazing quality !
david suchet is perfect in his role , and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either .
in no other movie that i 've seen so far has poirot been portrayed so brilliantly !
hats off to the producers -- they have made a movie that i along with many others will cherish for a long time to come !
