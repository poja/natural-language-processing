this film is one of my fondest childhood memories .
seeing the muppets ( at the height of their popularity ) heading hollywood , singing and dancing , with miss piggy googely-eying her beloved kermit , fozzie bear doing his best as everyone 's manager , and a generous cast of `` extras '' delivering a film that turned out to be `` okey dokey '' .kermit 's melancholy ukulele number `` rainbow connection '' was nominated for an oscar that year , but was beat out by norma rae 's `` it goes like it goes '' .
i 'll pick kermit 's song any day !
get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasy ... someday they 'll find it , the rainbow connections , the lovers , the dreamers and me !
