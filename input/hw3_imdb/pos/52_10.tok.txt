this is a must-see movie .
you will laugh , you will cry , and when it 's over you 'll wish there were more .
well-written and compelling , this movie draws you in and holds on tight .
the casting was perfect , the characters purposeful , and the performances outstanding .
`` nanny '' is the standard to which all women should hold themselves : strong , forgiving , protective , and never judgmental .
`` nanny '' , to me , is the epitome of what a christian mother and woman should be : a true pillar of the community .
if i were half the woman `` nanny '' is , i might consider myself to be doing okay .
i would have been devastated if `` nanny '' had died at some point in the movie , but since she did n't i will definitely buy this when it comes out on dvd .
i can only hope that the story continues and that ruben goes back to lackawanna to try to rebuild the town , piece by piece and person by person .
