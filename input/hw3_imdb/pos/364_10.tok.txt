this is another one of hitchcock 's highest rated movies and rightfully so .
this is a tale of two men who meet on a train and playfully exchange murder fantasies .
one of them ( robert walker ) takes it seriously and this leads guy haines ( farley granger ) to trouble with the law .
another fast moving hitchcock movie with lots of great scenes ( the carousel scene and the tennis match are worthy of mentioning ) .
not a movie to be missed- it is a shame that no one will re-release this on dvd with loads of extras- just a cheap warner brothers dvd is all thats out there now .
