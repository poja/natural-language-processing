this is one you can watch over and over and laugh just as much each time .
we have been on a keaton fest around here after purchasing some of his films .
in this one buster is mistaken for an escaped murderer and there are lots of chase scenes and crazy scenes but also what is best about buster - his creativity .
the opening scene is really funny and it just keeps going from there .
