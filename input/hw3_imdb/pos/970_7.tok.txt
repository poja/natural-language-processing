spoiler warningwe 've all heard the `` boy who cried wolf '' legend .
but what if the wolf was a person in the modern world .
well it might be something like big fat liar .
fourteen-year-old jason sheperd ( frankie muniz from `` malcolm in the middle '' ) is always lying to keep himself out of trouble .
one day he is pressured to write an english essay , but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film-maker marty wolf ( paul giamatti ) who plans to turn jason 's story into a hollywood blockbuster .
no one believes jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school .
however jason is determined to prove to his parents the truth and travels to l.a. with his friend kaylee ( amanda bynes ) .
when wolf refuses to admit he ripped off his story , jason plans to make wolf 's life a living hell .
b.f.l .
is no masterpiece but it 's a nice way to spend 90 minutes of you 're time .
i wished they could 've made it a bit longer though and there are n't that much pranks although they are clever enough ( i like the pool-dye the best ) .
i might not have liked this as much as i do if it were n't for paul giamatti .
he is simply hilarious in this .
if you have 90 minutes to kill try this out .
you might just enjoy it .
