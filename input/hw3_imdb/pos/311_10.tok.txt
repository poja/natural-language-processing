this movie changed the art of film making , telling a complex story in a powerful new way .
the film mixes brutal realism with fantasy , intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke .
the film uses music not as a score laid in later , but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers , radios etc .
coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration , taking scenes and characters , and putting them into entirely different surroundings .
that is a tricky and brave thing to do .
then he takes a superstar , brando , pays him a fortune , and films him so that you can barely see his face .
the pure guts that such a move requires is astounding , and it works beautifully .
this movie belongs in the top ten .
