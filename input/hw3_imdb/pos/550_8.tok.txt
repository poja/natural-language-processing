my one-line summary hints that this is not a good film , but this is not true .
i did enjoy the movie , but was probably expecting too much.adele , who is solidly portrayed by susan sarandon , did not come off as a very likable character .
she is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter .
this is the one thing she knows how to do without fail .
adele 's daughter , anna , is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother 's shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14-17 years old .
this , of course , makes natalie portman the perfect choice to play anna since she never seems to be 14- 17 years old either .
portman pulls this role off with such ease that you almost forget that she has not been making movies for 20 years .
yet , even with the two solid leads , wayne wang never seems to quite draw the audience in as he did with the joy luck luck and even more so with smoke .
though i have not read the book , the film feels as if it has made necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen , changes which may drain the emotional pungency of the story .
i enjoyed the film for the fun of watching two wonderful actresses do their work , but i never got lost in the experience and i never related to their plight .
