if you 're looking for a typical war movie , this is not it , so a note to all the testosterone-pumped carnage-craving war buffs out there , do n't bother .
although the film is about russian characters in wwii , do n't expect to see any nazis , cannons , blood , gore , etc .
it 's not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war .
it 's a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it.acting , cinematography , writing : all perfect 10s here .
you 'll certainly appreciate it if you 're russian like me , but even if not , you 'll probably love it .
if you speak no russian , look for the ruscico ( russian cinema council ) dvd version .
it 's got subtitles in about 14 different languages , but the english dubbing on this one i 'd say is just as good .
it 's of course not as good as the original russian track ( some stuff is lost in translation ) , but just as good as the english subtitles .
so go check it out , especially if you 're studying film in any aspect .
