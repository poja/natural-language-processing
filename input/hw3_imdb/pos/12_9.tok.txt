i was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater.we have all seen this plot line before ( top gun , gi jane , an officer and a gentleman ) but a good script still works .
this story is basically about the training of a coast guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines .
kevin costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader , ben randall , who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission .
the movie takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both the costner character and that of jake fischer , played by ashton kutcher .
i am happy to say that ashton is great in this part.there are no great surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what is coming long before it arrives .
however , the use of humor , the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching ben randall `` do his own thing as a trainer '' , kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained .
i really enjoy watching a movie that makes the entire audience laugh out loud , gasp here and there , and clap at the end as a tribute to the movie.we all had a good time ( despite a couple of tough moments in the movie ) and , i think , you will too .
