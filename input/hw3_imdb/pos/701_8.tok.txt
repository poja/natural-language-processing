i liked this western starring randolph scoot and glenn ford.it 's got pretty much everything a western should have.there 's gunfights , action , chases on horseback.there 's a bit of a romance angle that 's hinted at.there 's some nice comic relief in the form of edgar buchanan , who plays uncle willie mcleod , a character who pretend to be a doddering old fool , but is actually aware of everything going on.randolph scott plays the town sheriff , and glenn ford plays cheyenne rogers/bill smith , a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his ways.i liked the different mix of characters in the movie.i did n't find it always fast paced , but i never found it boring either.even though the movie is in 1943 , it is in colour .
