from the director of oldboy comes this slick vampire flick .
kang-ho song stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being cured of a deadly , mysterious virus .
his vampirism and priesthood are quite at conflict , but he is able to survive by robbing the hospital 's blood bank and unconscious patients who might not mind some siphoned blood .
because of his supposedly miraculous survival , he comes into the lives of ha-kyun shin 's family .
shin has cancer , and his mother believes that song can cure it .
unfortunately , song 's vampirism raises his levels of lust to a height where he ca n't help but fall for shin 's young wife , ok-vin kim .
kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism , and the two become lovers .
the film from there goes in weird directions that i think one should experience for themselves .
what really should be mentioned is chan-wook park 's mastery of the medium of cinema .
my god , i 've rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the peak of his powers .
the major flaw of the film is that it 's a little incoherent , especially near the beginning .
park is interested in telling his stories mostly in the visuals , which can be difficult to follow at times .
but when it works , man , does it fly .
the film is also perversely hilarious .
the final sequence , easily one of the best of the decade , is simultaneously heartbreaking and delightfully ridiculous .
ok-vin kim should become a worldwide star after this film .
she gives one of the best performances of the year .
