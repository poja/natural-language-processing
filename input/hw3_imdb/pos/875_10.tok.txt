this is one of the best films i 've seen in the last years.belmonndo and deneuve shine in their respective roles , he as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic trickster.words wo n't do this masterpiece justice , suffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the pain , humiliation and capacity for self-delusion that go with it , although it 's dressed as a film noir .
forget that feeble remake with jolie and banderas , see the genuine artticle instead and treat yourselves to some moments of great cinematic beauty .
