channel zapping one night i just caught the start of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning .
it tells the sad story of an adopted child , adam , whose mother left him after birth .
the movie takes us through his childhood , and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from adam 's past .
i will not reveal more , but it is a very in-depth movie and will intrigue you for sure .
this was one of jimmy smits best roles in my opinion .
