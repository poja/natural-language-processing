the main reason to check this one out is to watch laura gemser in all her glory.that 's reason enough for me.she heads to africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films .
huge mansion near the jungle .
hunters staying around for parties when they are n't out hunting zebras .
and said parties becoming drunken orgies.all the high society types in the emanuelle films seem to have out of control fetishes .
and emanuelle beds most of them.joe d'amato did not direct this one .
he just ripped it off and used the same cast ( s ) .
and did anyone notice the 'subliminal ' sexual images at the gas station ?
and why did most of the men stay dressed during the sex scenes ?
coherence ?
hardly any .
but goddess gemser is beautiful .
