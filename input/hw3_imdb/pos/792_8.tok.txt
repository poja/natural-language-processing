to my eternal shame , i 've never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire movies , `` nosferatu '' .
however , if they display half the creativity and sheer joy of this effort from buster keaton then i 'll probably try to watch a few more .
this is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies .
the premise , such as it is , focuses around an unfortunate case of mistaken identity as keaton is mistaken for renowned bad-guy dead shot dan ( co-director malcolm st clair ) .
this leads to a number of chases and escapes as the authorities get ever closer to the increasingly desperate keaton.you 're left amazed and entertained in equal measures .
keaton is a natural comedian but also an accomplished stunt-man , judging by the way he leaps and jumps around like jackie chan on speed .
and the comedy is also of an exceptionally high standard - my better half had to cut short a phone call to her parents because she was laughing too much !
if you 've never experienced a silent movie like this then it is nothing short of a revelation to watch - it certainly blew away any ideas i may have had about silent films .
naturally , it is n't as polished as today 's movies - the acting is pretty awful , truth be told but that does n't matter because you 're enjoying the movie regardless .
anyone with a passing interest in movies in general should make the effort to watch this because they will not be disappointed .
brilliant !
