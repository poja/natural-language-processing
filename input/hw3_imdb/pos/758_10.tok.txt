i was unsure what to expect from `` driving lessons '' - unsure whether rupert grint could carry such a role , but within the first few minutes i was completely hooked .
all the way through , the music , acting and scenery were absolutely stunning .
julie walters , as always , gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress evie , and rupert grint , equally as good , gave a fantastic performance as the romantic ben.right from the beginning , i was forced into involuntary cringes , bursts of laughter and swellings of joy as ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend , evie .
a very controversial story , probably rather exaggerated but none the less one of the best films i have seen in a long time.highly recommend to anyone seeking a good british film and an evening to kick-back and just enjoy yourself .
