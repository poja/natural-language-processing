i first viewed this movie when it first came out and also bought an lp recording of the soundtrack .
i liked it so well , i went back to see it several times.. can not understand why it was considered a flop .
julie andrews was lovely in this film , her voice was in top form and the costuming was beautiful !
the film contains a little bit of everything and even though some of the scenes were a bit heavy-handed , they were still fun .
i recently found i could get a copy in dvd form and ordered it ... ... i was disappointed that a couple of songs and sequences in the movie were not included in the version of the dvd i ordered .
