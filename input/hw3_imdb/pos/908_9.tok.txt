stan laurel regarded putting pants on philip as the first Â‘true ' l & h film .
the second hundred years was the first 'official ' l & h film , but this was the one where stan completely resigned himself not only to performing ( he had signed on with the hal roach studios as a director and 'gag-man ' , before certain situations - among them oliver hardy 's accident with a leg of lamb leading to stan having to replace him ; and the extra money that performing would provide for himself and his new wife , lois - brought about his historic return to performing , as well as writing , directing , editing and involvement in other areas of production ) , but also realised the fact that he was part of a team that worked well together .
this , therefore , is an historic and very important film in the history of comedy.it is also a surprisingly funny little silent film ; rather different from what laurel & hardy would become known for and from what they are more immediately associated with today .
the characters of 'stan & ollie do not appear - scottish stan laurel plays the nephew of oliver hardy , a respectable man about town who is reluctant to be seen with this strange-looking fellow with a kilt and the habit of chasing pretty girls .
there are some very funny moments in this well-made , charming little movie , and the performances of these two kings of comedy are spot-on - watch stan 's little 'scissor-kick ' and smile that says , `` well waddaya know ? ''
when he sees girls , or the hair-ruffling scene at the airport , for instance .
hilarious.watch this film if you can , with backing music from the beau hunks orchestra ( available on the vvl video releases ) which enhances the 1920s feel and is very , very pleasant to listen to .
it 's a brilliant and underrated little film , which is why i said it was 'surprisingly ' funny .
