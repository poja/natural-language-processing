'apocalypse now redux ' , francis ford coppola 's war opus is probably the most beautiful war film i have ever seen .
capt .
benjamin willard ( martin sheen ) is a vietnam soldier who is tapped to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into cambodia to 'terminate the position ' of col. kurtz ( marlon brando ) , a highly ranked and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and defected from the army , setting up his own little society and helped by a cultish following of soldiers .
escorting him up the river to cambodia is a handful of navy men , and along the way , they encounter several interesting people ( most notably is robert duvall 's kilgore , a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose ) and some horrifying situations .
'apocalypse ' is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study .
it is more 'full metal jacket ' than 'platoon ' .
the running time of 'apocalypse ' is over three hours , but the film is so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrived , i was actually surprised at the amount of time that had passed .
the beautiful cinematography is surely what stood out the most for me , however .
after seeing this film , i am convinced that coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history .
the 'godfather ' films were all tinged with an almost sepia tone , and shadows created the feeling of a baroque composition .
with 'apocalypse ' , there is an incredible usage of natural light , and the shadows , particularly in the scenes involving brando and sheen , almost become a living character , they are so pervasive and effective .
another gorgeous scene was when cpt .
willard and jay hicks ( frederic forrest ) were in the jungle looking for mangoes , and come across a tiger .
the sheer enormity of the surrounding foliage ( leaves as big as a house ) made the characters almost lilliputian , but the colorization of the scene was incredible .
while everything else was almost a muted grey , the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green , an effect that was particularly striking .
another really minor positive moment in the film was the great scene when the helicopters carrying duvall and company attack the small village while playing wagner .
this could have just been an ultra-dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene , but instead coppola turns the song into an actual part of the scene , with duvall mentioning that he likes to play it while they are approaching to 'scare the hell out of them ' .
the performances in 'apocalypse ' are first class .
much has been made of the amount of money brando earned for the film , and the amount of trouble he caused .
regardless of this , he turned out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time .
sheen is completely outstanding - this is the first time i have seen him really unleash in a film Â– and duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony kilgore .
'apocalypse now ' is a film that is so pervasive in pop culture by now ( most know several choice lines from the film , 'i love the smell of napalm in the morning ' et al ) but i knew little enough about it that there were plenty of surprises left to experience .
i have not seen the original cut of 'apocalypse now ' so i can not compare it to this newer cut , but this is a film that should most certainly be experienced .
8/10 -- shelly
