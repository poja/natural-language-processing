never having read or seen the bard 's original work , i ca n't begin to compare this work to his story .
so i wo n't .
instead i will just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects ( and some that looked a little lower in budget , but still decent enough to enjoy ) .
i thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing .
the style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing , but i thought it was well done .
