kannathil muthamittal is for sure a great movie .
i have to give it to mani ratnam for a great directing job and a.r .
rahman for great songs .
the camera work is just excellent and is similar to black hawk down and saving private ryan .
i will be shocked if this movie does not win an oscar for best foreign film or even best camera work .
