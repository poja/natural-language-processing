love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking losely at it love was just as strong as in the west and war was often more poignant ( should i say more realistic ? )
.this film is as much about war and love as it is about the soviet thaw of mr k 's era .
it also reminds us than the best war movies were not necessarily made in the 1990 's with rivers of hemoglobin and millions of usd spent on special effects and marketed actors.this movie is a classic of soviet cinema and a outstanding picture of one of the greatest human tragedies : war .
