this is a classic continuation to bleu , the likewise excellent film , with juliet binouche as a main star , moreover , she is a cameo appearance here , in rouge , just for a second at the very end .
but this film , truly red and very sweet although very sad , is a real winner .
the main heroine , played by ever great irene jakob , is a successful photo / fashion model .
she leads a full , active life , only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend mike , who is in england .
by some lucky chance , she gets friendly with the old judge , who spends time listening to the private telephone talks of his neighbors .
the story starts to weave even further , and we see him in court , being almost universally condemned for his pastime .
she is the only one who feels sympathy for him , for his cute doggy rita and her pups , and for all the people who surround them .
we also witness the break-up of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady , and their quarrel is also fueled by that telephone scandal ... but the film is not about this , even .
it is mostly about the loneliness and deep rifts between people , far and near .
when she sails to england on a ferry , with that lawyer as a chance fellow-passenger , as well as that earlier mentioned binoche who starred in bleu , the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of the judge when he watches the news trying to guess if she survived .
she did , and still we feel very heavy at heart .
mr. kislowski managed to draw a grand , subtle story about the solitude , misunderstanding , secrets and pain .
deep , dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely .
brilliant film .
