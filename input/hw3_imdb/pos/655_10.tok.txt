this movie bombed at the box office and in the voting here but i loved it .
one measure of a movie 's worth is how much of it you can still remember after 25 years .
i wo n't bore you with a list but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes , also a good story and great casting .
the inept robbers are a hoot .
see it and judge if it ever gets on tcm .
