i thought it was going to be a lousy movie , honestly , i mean , rupert grint , ron , acting in a movie different from harry potter , was actually really difficult to picture it .
but as the movie started , it showed that this guy does have talent , i mean , is the best actor of the hp trio , for reference , have you seen emma watson trying to act ?
or what about daniel 's acting ?
both lack experience even though they have acted in a million harry potter movies .
ben , his character is a very shy boy , incapable of showing his true feelings about everything , his despise about his over ruling mom and the resentful anger towards his father who is unable to step up and confront his unfaithful wife .
julie walters was absolutely brilliant !
her interpretation of an old retired actress trying to live with the shadow of her past , while she tries to remember shakespearian sonnets is absolutely wonderful !
also , it appears that many youth is wasted in religious nonsense acts .
