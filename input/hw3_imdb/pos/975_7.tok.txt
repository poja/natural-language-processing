much better than expected .
good family flick - catch it on reruns .
the whole is more than the sum of its parts .
paul giamatti chews up the scenery - he has way more talent then the role deserves .
a treat to watch inspector uhl from `` the illusionist '' go over the top .
the blue man scenes had my 11 year old in stitches .
the cameos were particular fun for the parents - nice to see lee majors and urkel ( umm , jaleel ) again .
it 's going to be tough to think up 10 lines for this film , but let 's hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and their parents !
amanda bynes does a fine job when she gets to be part of the sting .
i normally ca n't stand frankie muniz but he is just fine here .
hats off to the casting director - if only for hiring giamatti !
