the finest short i 've ever seen .
some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened , due to the density of insight it offers .
there 's irony in that comment and little merit .
the acting is all up to noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly .
i might have preferred that the narrator be less `` recognizable '' , but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect .
this is a short for people who read , for those whose `` bar '' is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty .
a beautiful short film .
fwiw : i was pleased at the picasso reference , since i once believed that picasso was just another art whore with little talent ; like , i assume , most people - until the day i saw some drawings he made when he was 12. picasso was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime .
i understood immediately why he had to make the art he became known for .
