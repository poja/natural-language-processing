susan sarandon and natalie portman play adele and ann august , a single mother who 's the working definition of the word `` dreamer '' and her solemn , pragmatic daughter .
adele , wanting to make a fresh start in a big city , moves them from wisconsin to california.decent , if not exceptional or particularly memorable , with some serious and sad moments .
it pushes some emotional buttons , that 's for sure .
best thing it offers is a solid cast , and sarandon and portman are quite good in the leads - even if their characters are one-dimensional at times.could be better , could be worse.i gave this one seven out of ten .
