if you love chan-wook park , you know what to expect .
his films are brutal , poetic , tragic , and artistic , with splashes of very grim humor .
thirst is clearly park 's style , and i loved every second of it , from the cinematography ( every shot is gorgeous and creative ) to the story , which blends shakespearean tragedy , murderous love , gothic horror , and layered character drama .
the characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around .
even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy .
the direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced - like sympathy for mr. vengeance , there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing .
chan-wook park is an intelligent , bold , consistently surprising filmmaker .
it 's unpredictable - scenes go from brutal and heart-wrenching to laugh-out-loud hilarious in an instant .
this is closer to lady vengeance then sympathy for mr. vengeance as far as being over-the-top and comical .
but , like lady vengeance , it 's incredibly rich , thought-provoking , and rewarding.if you like beautifully told vampire stories ( let the right one in ) or are a fan of chan-wook park , seeing thirst should be obvious .
easily one of the best films of 2009 .
