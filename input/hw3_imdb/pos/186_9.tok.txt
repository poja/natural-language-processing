this is a magnificent , and in many ways impressive film .
i saw it on tv as a little boy , with my throat almost strangled with tears , and again today on the magnificently restored criterion dvd.cranes is the very essence of the war weepie .
imagine umbrellas of cherbourg with no music and no color , or waterloo bridge with no class consciousness.tatiana samoilova , a cross between vivien leigh and bjork , is deeply affecting as a pretty girl whose fiancé enlists and does n't write or come back.the fiancé , boris , dies on the front , and his death scene is indescribably romantic .
very daring too , because so close to `` over the top . ''
but that scene will stay with you.although the soviets were so defined by wwii , the movie is quite unspecific , and more powerful for it .
the pre-war and post-war scenes have a very 1957 feel .
there is no attempt at period detail .
the whole film becomes more and more stylized , until the siberian scenes , which feel like a modern opera set ( that is a compliment ) .
the cathartic final scene is milked to its last drop - there again , comparable to cherbourg .
the production feels like a big budget ( those staircase scenes must have cost a pretty kopek ) .go for it .
do n't expect a bitter socialist pill ( although it is , of course , very sad ) .
the cranes are flying is an impressive slice of world cinema , quite advanced considering where and when it was made .
