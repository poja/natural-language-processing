i first saw this on thames television and loved it .
i subsequently saw a dreadful write-up by someone who certainly had n't watched or listened to it .
so , i bought a copy and then i bought another copy !
the only sad thing is that it is not available on pal vhs or region 2 dvd .
the australian version is great , but this one is better !
i might buy another ... ... ... ... .
