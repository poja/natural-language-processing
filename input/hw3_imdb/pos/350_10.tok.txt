ever since 1981 , nintendo has been making great video games such as super mario and zelda .
most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years .
games made by nintendo never seem to get boring because they 're always adding something new .
it went from arcade games to the wii and i hear that there 's a new version of the wii scheduled for release in 2011. the thing that makes wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons .
and i have more good news .
super mario galaxy 2 is to be released in 2010 .
