this was gene kelly 's breakthrough , and that alone makes it memorable .
throw in rita hayworth as his love interest and comedian phil silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser , which is exactly how it turned out.kelly plays danny mcguire , a nightclub owner in brooklyn ( brooklyn is always the `` wrong side of the tracks '' in '40s films ) whose star attraction and love interest is rusty parker ( rita hayworth ) .
rita is lovely , and even plays a dual role as rusty and rusty 's grandmother .
rusty has a chance at the big time through the machinations of john coudair ( otto kruger ) , who romanced and lost rusty 's grandmother.the plot revolves around danny cutting rusty loose , to the detriment of his club , because she has a chance at success that he ca n't give her .
but , naturally , that 's not what rusty ultimately wants , because , as usual in films of that time , the right guy is the only thing on the girl 's mind .
there are no surprises , but everybody does their thing well.kelly does the first of his amazing trick dances , this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window .
he was the master at that sort of dance , and one still has to wonder how they timed everything so precisely so that he really does seem to be in two places at once .
the melodrama gets a bit thick , and there are some gratuitous war references thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two , but kelly takes this film to the next level .
this was before he became a mega-star and too smooth perhaps for his own good .
an underlying edge of rawness to his character lends it a believable and almost wistful air.kelly 's character in the 1980 `` xanadu '' also was named danny mcguire .
this film was the beginning , that film the end , of a terrific run for a dancing genius .
clearly , this film meant a lot to him .
highly recommended .
