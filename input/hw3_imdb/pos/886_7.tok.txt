after seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films , i thought it looked very entertaining .
before watching the movie i went on to imdb to see what ratings and comments it received .
i was worried when i noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings .
despite the hype , i watched to movie and to my surprise i found it unbelievable .
the story was great ( just pay attention ) and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing .
i have n't seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time .
i really felt for both characters and sensed a strong bond .
as reading previous posts about this movie not being `` epic '' enough or a lack of martial arts i could not disagree more .
this film is what it is , its not braveheart and its not enter the dragon but it is still a wonderful film that does an excellent job combining story both and action.while sword in the moon is n't perfect ( what movie is ? )
it still is wonderful and moving .
just wait until the ending scene , with the music and cinematography together , its breathtaking .
i only hope more people can see this movie to give it a fair voting .
