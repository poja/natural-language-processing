brilliant aussie movie ... a little slow at the beginning , but once it gets going you ca n't stop laughing .
when i originally saw the movie i vaguely knew the plot line , as i am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story , and more so in particular , the director and his mother ( obviously names have been changed ) .
i only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family .
when i saw the movie , somehow my stepmum kept it secret that we were to meet matthew newton after the screening ... such a nice gentleman ( except for a particularly nasty incident with his ex ) !
brillian casting as well with sam neill and others !
a great reason to keep supporting the australian film industry
