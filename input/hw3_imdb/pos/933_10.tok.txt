the final part of kieslowski 's trilogy based on the colors of the french flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematic image .
in red , imagery is paramount , as well as the obvious but clever color coding .
however , rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the 'cinema du look ' , kieslowski 's red is a multi-layered , densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love .
in red , love and fate are intertwined but complex notions , dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by .
you sense red is really an allegory , a reenactment of prospero 's omnipresent gestures in the tempest , yet it is more than its story appears .
red demands countless viewings , and in each viewing something new is discovered that weaves itself into the already immaculately plotted structure.although red stands alone as a masterwork from kieslowski , it 's best viewed as part of the trilogy .
elements of blue and white are referenced in red , which knowing viewers will enjoy .
