i could n't stop watching this movie , though it was far past my bedtime .
comparisons to hitchcock are deserved -- this thing really plays with you .
it walks a wonderful line between real , immediate suspense and a dark , distancing humor .
like many of hitch 's heroes , our doe-eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her , at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear , at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy.the filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out .
right from the opening shots , they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fabrication ; who is to be trusted and who is a monster .
the plot twists and turns unpredictably .
suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen camerawork , imagery , music -- but most simply the eyes of the characters , which sends raw fear right into you .
a warning : there is some frighteningly real gore , as well as some nudity .
the horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage-slasher pic.and a teen-slasher pic it ai n't .
the characters are quirky and feel like real people , for one thing -- a couple ( including the heroine ) you may even find endearing as i did .
there will be no mistake you 're watching a movie made for grown-ups .
i mean , alec guinness is in it , briefly , and you know he did n't need the work !
pop this in the vcr some night when you ca n't sleep .

and do n't want to , yet .
