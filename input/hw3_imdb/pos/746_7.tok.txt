do n't look in the basement this little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the video nasties list .
the flute-sitar-rattle box soundtrack is classic .
the main character , although way hotter than most low budget starlets , is a pretty standard low budget lead .
the doctor masters character is well written and well acted .
some of the lesser characters are kinda stupid but add to the nostalgia of the movie .
it 's campy .
i ai n't trying to lie .
the character that makes this great is a faulknarian man-child named sam , one of the patients in this sanitarium-gone-mad-flick .
the gore is pretty standard although i think the color of the blood is awesome .
it 's so ..red .
this movie , i believe , was received poorly because of it advertising scheme .
some soulless little ad executive got his grubby hands on it and thought `` let 's rip of the ad campaign for last house on the left , that 's doing well '' .
little chumps like this have ruined the world of film .
all balls and no brain .
also , the editor may or may not have been an alcoholic .
maybe there all drunk .
you 'll see what i mean .
one more little note .
do n't buy this from the wally-mart dollar rack .
they have cut it to and unwatchable level .
try to find the longest cut you can .
