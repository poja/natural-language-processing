while many pass this off as a b movie it is , indeed , a first class comedy that is well-written and acted .
red skelton is great as wally benton better known to radio fans as the fox .
ann rutherford is perfect as wally 's fiance carol lambert .
conrad veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals .
i read one account of this movie which states that vincente minelli directed this film , not unless he changed his name to s. sylvan simon , who directed all three of the fox movies .
this is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged .
so get over your black and white prejudice if you have one , sit back and enjoy a truly great comedy .
this was also red 's first starring role .
take note during the climax of the reference to orson welles ' war of the worlds broadcast .
