this movie must be exported to the rest of the world !
an absolute masterpiece , with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in sweden .
the one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four , odd story about love or career .
i would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended .
also the unique pause in the middle is something i 've never seen before.ca n't wait for the series ( if they 're doing one ) or the extended dvd .
apparently they had cut out a lot to fit it in to just 3,5 hours .
