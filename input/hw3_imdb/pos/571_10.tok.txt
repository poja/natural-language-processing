i do n't need to say much about how good this documentary is -- it 's truly an amazing piece of true narrative .
the story is simple enough : a white senior citizen tourist is murdered by a young black man in florida , and the boy who is arrested is mistreated and put on trial with only the public defender and his family on his side .
it 's very enthralling , and the public defender is a joy to watch in all his human ways -- you ca n't help but pull for the triumph of justice , and the ending fulfills more than could be expected of a true story.it 's a shame more people have n't seen this documentary , but hopefully you will find a way to watch it .
for those interested in race relations in the united states , and the actual workings of law enforcement and the legal process , it 's well worth your time and effort to find this documentary .
i give it a 10 .
