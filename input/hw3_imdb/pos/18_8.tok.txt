`` the dresser '' is perhaps the most refined of backstage films .
the film is brimming with wit and spirit , for the most part provided by the `` energetic '' character of norman ( tom courtenay ) .
although his character is clearly gay , and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer ( albert finney ) that he assists , the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is.the gritty style of peter yates that worked so well in `` bullitt '' is again on display , and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence .
this is much appreciated in a story that could so easily have become tedious .
in the end , `` the dresser '' will bore many people silly , but it will truly be a delight to those who love british cinema.7.7 out of 10
