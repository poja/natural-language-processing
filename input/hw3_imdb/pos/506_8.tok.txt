blade is a dark , gloomy , but significent vampire movie and is one of the best ones .
a bit of gore , but nothing really that bad .
wesley snipes played a strong role as he eliminates the vampires .
not really like buffy , because thats too tame but blade delivers a decent plot and it 's the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark stormy night ... .thats at best viewing !
