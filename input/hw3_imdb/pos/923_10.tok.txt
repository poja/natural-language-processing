well every scene so perfectly presented .
never before had i seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene.well while i was watching this movie i remembered watching `` amilie '' .
amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch .
these movies are both based on a same plot line .
but both of them are perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own.red is able to provoke lots of thoughts in people about destiny and dejavu s. and i am still thinking about it.the story is great and the ending is a bit funny .
i was laughing in the end scene .
well funny how this three movie red white and blue are connected.all in all a great work of art .
a work of a masterman.10/10
