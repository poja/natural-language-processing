very memorable comedy .
it 's fun to watch the many situations develop and finally converge after a long journey on that greatest collection of eclectic humanity ( and the world 's largest honky-tonk ) - the great american freeway .
like `` ... mad , mad world '' it 's got loads of contemporary talent , old-boy politics , good comedic action and dialog .
unlike that one it is the target that seeks , not the unwitting seekers - they have no idea what they really want as they drift along america 's great road .
nor does it carry the weight of having a great fall guy who is saved only in the end by a great belly-laugh .
but the ending stunt sequence is nothing short of spectacular with excellent film editing , humor and timing , and the big city bank scene is hilarious with very original acting by one very talented character in particular .
the total aplomb of the city dwellers in the face of chaos leaves one feeling like the proverbial fly on the ceiling .
the slapstick is funny , but honky tonk freeway deserves to be heard and seen closely because it is surprisingly loaded with nuance and character reactions that are easily missed .
all in all a very funny reflection of who we were and are , good or bad , and the goofy situations we find ourselves in .
it was just meant to be funny and it is !
