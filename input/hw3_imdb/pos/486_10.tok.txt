i just watched it for the second time today and i must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings .
such a waste of human life as this story was maybe some good will come out of it .
and eric is hotter than ever .
to often in the movies first nations people are seen as other than everyday people .
we are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people .
hey we are just like everyone else .
and this movie showed just that .
we hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice .
it is really to bad that the big movie companies cant see that .
i cant wait till this comes out on dvd .
thanks to those who chose to show this story as it really was .
