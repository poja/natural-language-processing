and there are not many in cinema history .
`` rouge '' seems to be a bit of a hope .
hope in mankind and in life .
but to say only that may be naive .
kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of that embittered judge and the twentish but wise model .
perhaps that old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated -there 's the new couple with the young judge after the accident- .
but what to say about this master of the camera ?
you ca n't miss a second of the movie because you have to watch every and each one of those faces .
kieslowski loved human beings and that is quite evident in the way the camera treats the actors .
ms. jacob and mr. tringtignant are perfect it 's not only this movie but the downbeat `` thou shall not kill '' and `` a story about love '' that may you think about contemporary cinema as a way of expressing an artist 's point of view .
pity american public -the average one- could not see these films .
at least they are not in the maltin 's dictionary .
and even the baseline does not know what to say about this unique man .
