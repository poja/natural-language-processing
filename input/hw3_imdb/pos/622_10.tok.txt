this is a very good movie .
i give it a 10.it 's very different in that it 's kind of a long stalking scene all the way through .
the fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way.she sees a murder ( for a snuff-movie ) and decides to run but is chased ( this takes quite some time ) .
i wo n't reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience , but rest assured : it 's very believable , well played , very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending.do n't miss this movie .
