gen-y cops ... since i heard of the film being in release , i have been wanting to see it because i loved gen-x cops .
i was a little disappointed that a ) nicholas tse did n't return and b ) too much slapstick .
nevertheless , i enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film , but it is good in its own way.stephen fung returns as the ultracool ladies man match , who has a steady girl in oli ( note : where is haze ? )
and sam lee returns as the insane alien ( this time sporting a mohawk and speaking a lot of english !
!
!
! )
.
the real star of the film is newcomer edison chen .
he makes a great replacement for nicholas tse as ... edison .
i also enjoyed paul rudd 's performance of agent curtis ... he seems to be the tough as nails , smartmouth fbi agent you 'd love to hate ... but soon , you 'd like his character.the fight scenes are a lot better in this one ... even though there are very few , but they are great , courtesy of jackie chan stuntman nicky li.look for a cameo from ron smoorenburg as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with match .
smoorenburg also is the stunt double for rudd.if you liked gen-x cops ... you 'll love gen-y cops !
