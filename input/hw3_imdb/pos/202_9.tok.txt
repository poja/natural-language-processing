in moscow , the young couple veronika ( t. samojlova ) and boris ( aleksey batalov ) are in deep love for each other .
with the world war ii , boris volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front on the day before veronika 's birthday , and they do not have the chance to say goodbye to each other .
while waiting for news from boris , veronika is raped by boris ' cousin mark ( a. shvorin ) and they marry each other .
however , veronika does not forget boris , and keeps waiting for him .
`` letyat zhuravli '' is an impressive and heartbreaking romance in times of war .
the direction is excellent and uses ellipses along the story , inclusive in the capital scene when veronika is raped by mark .
the camera-work is amazing , with sophisticated planes and angles , and long traveling .
the scenes of veronika in the middle of the tanks , or in the train station with many figurants are awesome .
the magnificent cinematography is highlighted by the restored image of the dvd .
t. samojlova has an extremely beautiful face , and a touching and sensitive performance .
the speech in the last scene makes another great example of an anti-war movie .
my vote is nine.title ( brazil ) : `` quando voam as cegonhas '' ( `` when fly the stork '' )
