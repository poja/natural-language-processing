as a teenager , i watched this movie every time it was on tv ( and it was on a lot ) because of its witty , appealing-to-teenager humor .
it may not be what critics consider 4 star viewing , but i love it for what it is -- a fun comedy meant to please the audience .
the teen actors are of my generation ( probably why i love the movie so much ) and was like a fantasy cast of everyone 's favorite tv shows of the early 90 's -- full house , family matters , fresh prince -- all of the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90 's .
though it may not include the high doses of nudity and violence that so many teen movie writers think vital to success among the youth demographic ( or perhaps because of its absence ) , i highly recommend it to pre-teens and teenagers everywhere .
