the many other comments about the film say it all - just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our community cinema , and it got an overall average score of 8.6. we 'd 100 % recommend it , then , for today 's audiences , especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen , and can talk about it with others afterwards , as our audience did.the sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding .
of course , finney and courtenay were truly the stars .
but everybody was thoroughly well cast .
for our afternoon audience , the majority of whom are `` senior citizens '' , the fact that the plot could be followed with such ease because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non-techy use of camera and sound was a great influencehow delightful , many said , to see a really great film that 's british : still not dated twenty years on : not full filled with blood & guts : not confusing because of bob-about-all-over-the-place camera shots , and back and forth through time story lines : no seedy sex scenes .
such views were even uttered by some who were younger .
