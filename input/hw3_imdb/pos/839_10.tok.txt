the third and final female prisoner scorpion film directed by shunya ito .
the series ' star , meiko kaji , would complete the series in the fourth installment , grudge song , directed by the capable yasuhara hasebe ( who also directed kaji in the excellent stray cat rock : sex hunter ) .
the original female prisoner # 701 : scorpion is one of my all-time favorites .
the sequel , jailhouse 41 , is nearly as good .
it 's generally considered the best of the series , and i might agree , i think , if it ever gets a better release on dvd ( the original , by image , is very poor ) .
beast stable , in my opinion , is nearly as good as fp701 .
it 's much slower , much more contemplative .
it has its share of violence and nastiness , but there 's more focus on the story and the characters .
sasori ( kaji ) eludes detectives in the first scene ( she is handcuffed to one and lops his arm off Â– and escapes with it in tow , which must be seen to be believed ! )
and hooks up with a freelance prostitute , yuki .
yuki is being hassled by a local prostitution ring , which includes a goofy-looking madame with a cage full of pet crows .
what really surprised me is how sad the movie is .
yuki 's story , which is never resolved , it heartbreaking .
the images are startling , and ito 's direction is masterful .
it 's too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the fp701 series .
this is an awesome film .
