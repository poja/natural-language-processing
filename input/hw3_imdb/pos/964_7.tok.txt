i was n't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script.. who then he travels to hollywood to get even.. but.. hey.. it 's still a fun film .
frankie muniz of `` malcom in the middle '' fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and amanda bynes as his friend is also very good .
yea the film does work as an advertisement for universal studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film.. but i enjoyed it anyways .
grade : b-
