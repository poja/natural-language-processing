julie andrews plays a german spy who falls in love with an american pilot rock hudson , while on an assignment for germany.the songs are beautiful .
the two are well-paired .
julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays .
a half-german , half-english girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in ww i , julie sings some endearing mancini songs .
i loved the film .
some will say it 's a `` chick-flick , '' but so what .
it 's wonderful .
supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped .
it may not be up to rock 's performance in pillow talk , magnificent obsession , or giant.blake edwards shot the film in ireland and authentic ww i -type planes were used in the film .
scenery for england and france is absolutely gorgeous .
