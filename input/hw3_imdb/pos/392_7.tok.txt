dylan and bobby are boyhood friends and they are in love the way that young boys sometimes are .
but dylan has met a girl and is starting to put those boyhood things aside .
bobby knows that he 's not interested in girls and misses what he had with dylan .
told as part cheesy 80 's pop video , part home movie , part video recollection this film tells a confusing and sad , but all too often true , story that will hit home with many that see it .
this film brings back a lot of memories and struck a very true chord with me but i wish the film maker had gone a bit further and left it on a happier note .
yes , we all love and lose , even when we are young , but there 's always tomorrow , especially when we are young .
