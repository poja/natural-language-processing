i saw this movie last night on hbo & did n't expect to get hooked - i usually fall asleep when i watch hbo .
but it happened & you will too .
it 's a tragic documentary ( 2002 oscar winner ) about a murder of an elderly female tourist in jacksonville , florida and subsequent investigation , arrest , & trial of a 15 year old boy.watch this movie today & get a feel for how we have progressed as a society .
this film was most deserving of an esteemed oscar - you 'll be moved to tears .
