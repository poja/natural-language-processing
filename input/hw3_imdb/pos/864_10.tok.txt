hilarious and low-budget comedy at it 's best .
this set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is reminiscent of a really raunchy kids in the hall .
be prepared for some of the most random and recitation worthy lines , filled with ethnic slurs and awful language .
sex toys included !
there should be more comedy like this around today .
this collection of sketches on one dvd will warrant many viewings and reviewings in order to appreciate some of the parts .
if you enjoyed the state and/or wet hot american summer , get ready for some more glory .
if you are even considering this for younger audiences i would say that every child on earth should see this .
