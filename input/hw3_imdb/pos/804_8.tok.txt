just after having moved into his new cottage in the english country , hercule poirot gets an invitation to dinner from sir henry and lady angkatell , the owners of a large mansion nearby .
but the next day , one of the guests is found shot near the pool , and his clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few steps away ... .this agatha christie mystery is somewhat thin , though the killer 's plan is still very clever .
it 's the exquisite filming and cinematography that elevate the story to a higher level .
this episode mostly keeps the serious tone of `` five little pigs '' and `` sad cypress '' , but contains more dark humor than them .
the cast includes possibly the two most famous actors to have worked in the series by this point , edward fox ( as the butler ) and sarah miles ( as lady angkatell ) , though the standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful megan dodds as the ahead-of-her-time henrietta : her one-on-one confrontations with suchet sparkle and are the highlights of the film .
oh , and since an english police inspector does get involved in the case , i think they could have brought philip jackson back for this one .
