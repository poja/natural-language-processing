okay , so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again ! '
week in , week out david morse 's character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what 's wrong with that !
?
david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there , and certainly the coolest , and to have him in a series created by david koepp - a great writer - is heaven !
!
due to the lack of love for this show by many , i ca n't see it going to a season series - but you never know ?
the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me - let 's hope something good can make it past a first series !
