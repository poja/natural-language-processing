although it does n't seem very promising for a long stretch , renoir 's french cancan ends up being an effortlessly charming film .
the story is cliché : a laundry girl , nini ( françoise arnoul ) , is discovered by a night club owner , danglard ( jean gabin ) .
danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend , both of whom come back for their former lovers .
nini has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker , go on with the show with her employer , oh , or become a princess , as a prince falls in love with her at one point , too .
i 'm glad the film did n't go for the most obvious choice , as a lesser film certainly would have .
the film ends with the opening of danglard 's new night club , the moulin rouge , and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers .
the first of them , `` complainte de la butte , '' which also provides the base of most of the film 's musical score , is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written , and renoir himself wrote it .
if you 're a fan of baz luhrmann 's 2001 film moulin rouge !
, you 'll recognize the tune , as it comes up near the beginning of that film , sung by rufus wainwright .
although it is n't very prominent in that film , everyone i know who owns the soundtrack loves it .
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written , french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen .
it 's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl .
8/10 .
