anatole litvak directed the 1959 film , `` the journey , '' starring yul brynner , deborah kerr , robert morley , e.g .
marshall , anne jackson , and jason robards.the film takes place during the 1956 hungarian uprising and concerns a group of travelers having problems getting out of budapest because of political problems in that part of the world .
they are put on a bus to vienna , but the russians , led by major surov ( brynner ) confiscate their passports and hold them for questioning .
one of the passengers is paul fleming ( robards ) , posing as an american but in reality a hungarian freedom fighter , whom the major believes is being smuggled out of hungary .
in fact , lady ashmore ( kerr ) is hiding him .
she becomes the focus of the major 's romantic attentions.very good film that conveys the tension and hassle of the cold war , and all of the performances are wonderful .
brynner is particularly excellent as the passionate major who is n't all bad , and anne jackson gives a realistic , powerful performance as a pregnant woman who does n't want her child born in a communist country.good script , good director , good cast - there should be more films like this .
highly recommended .
