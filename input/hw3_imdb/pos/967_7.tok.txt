big fat liar is a pretty funny movie .
but as i was watching it , i thought about something .
some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable .
so really , the film is kind of a big fat lie .
there is no way that he could 've gotten away with all of this .
here are all of the unbelievable stuff.1 .
when he fakes his father had choked on a meatball , and acts like he is the father .
jason ( frankie munez ) could n't have gotten away with that .
well , luckily for us , he did n't .
so it did n't stick with it , the outrageous.2.even if the grandmother was blind , she still could 've figured out that that was n't her granddaughter .
3.they could n't have gotten on the plane , flown to l.a. , acted like they were coat salesmen , sneak into the studio , and then , and then ... well , some of the film is a little unbelievable .
but it does n't hurt to tell a little white lie .
trust me , i do it all the time.big fat liar , though unbelievable at times , is fun .
it 's also very funny .
but let me just say one thing before i continue this review .
if paul giamatti was n't in this movie , it would really suck .
it would be horrible .
big fat liar is also pretty funny , though corny at times .
i give it a thumbs up.big fat liar : ***/****
