if you love drive-in cheeze from the early '70s you will just love this one.how could you go wrong with a low budget film about bloodshed in a lunatic asylum ?
you ca n't !
crazy folks and sharp objects are always an entertaining combination.the film looks like it was shot inside someone 's house for about $ 320.65 .
for me that just ads to the fun of watching this type of stuff.the gore is a bit mild compared to others of this ilk , but there is enough to keep us bloodthirsty sickos ( like myself ) happy.some horror films drag in parts and leave you waiting for something to happen.that 's not the case here.the characters are entertaining enough to make every frame quite enjoyable.there is never a dull moment from start to finish.the mind melting climax at the end that is just unbelievable .
i liked it so much that right after the end credits i watched it a second time.it 's an absolute must see for any self respecting drive-in horror nut.9.5/10 on the drive-in-freak-o-meter ... required viewingyea i love you..i do love you ... now take your thorazine and put your clothes back on ... please ... .8 )
