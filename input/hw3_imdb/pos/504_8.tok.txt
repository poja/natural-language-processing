however closely the movie is to the comics , it does n't matter .
this movie radically moves away from the boredom of `` interview with the vampire '' ( although it 's acting was good ) and slides in the wonderful action scenes .
very convincing tale and interesting with surprisingly good acting from all .
disadvantage - poor graphics .
does it matter ?
nope .
