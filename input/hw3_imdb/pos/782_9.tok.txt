i only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts , and to be honest , i did n't know how much i would like it .
i switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised .
driving lessons is a modest , simple film which draws you in right from the start .
rupert grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly .
he 's definitely one to look out for in the future .
dame eve walton is played by the fabulous julie walters .
i loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity .
the highlight of the film , for me was evie 's rather colourful poem .
it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs .
in my opinion , watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours .
the scenery was also striking , especially the countryside .
anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable , i strongly disagree with
