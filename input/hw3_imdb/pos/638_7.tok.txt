if you enjoy suspense this movie has it .
the fact that marina zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense .
alec guiness 's appearance was nice , but did n't really add to the movie .
i 'm not sure if evan richard 's part as andy clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot .
i thought the cinematography was excellent .
this added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well .
the bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful .
also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to andy clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done .
i would call it overall good entertainment
