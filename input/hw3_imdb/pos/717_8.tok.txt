the film is not for everyone .
some might think the acting is bad when it is actually understated and natural .
there are no obviously evil acts and there are no stunningly beautiful moments .
there is a lot of indecision , an lot of conflicting feelings.actually this film takes a very honest look at a very complex subject , sex with minors .
it is complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when her body and hormones are still developing and both of their minds and personalities are still developing .
complex also because society has very simplistic views of sex with minors , and complex , because the characters do n't know if society is right or if their instincts are right.some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions .
questions such as who was really in charge of the relationship , who was damaged , did good come out of it , was it art , who was damaged more , did some of the problems with their relationship stem from it being forbidden by society , did some of the problems stem from their own immaturity , and probably most important , was this truly a crime ?
the film is resolutely neutral on all of this , and it is this neutrality that is its strength .
it is the reason for the understated acting , the simple sets , the lack of background music , soft lighting , and the general `` flat '' presentation .
the message is clear .
we do n't really understand this kind of relationship today , and quick judgments are bound to be shallow .
