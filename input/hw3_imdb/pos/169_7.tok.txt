this movie is great .
80 's sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse , so they kill everyone they see .
the reason they kill makes practically no sense , but it just adds to the charm of this movie .
and dang , these kids are crazy , especially curtis .
if you 've seen the movie , you know who i am talking about .
that kid 's vicous !
although the movie does n't have much gore , it is entertaining , and for some reason you kind of care about the characters .
it also has some nice nudity .
has some decent acting as well , really a decent 80 's slasher movie , it 's worth a look if you ever get the chance to see it .
you 'll have nightmares about those darn kids though , i guarantee you !
