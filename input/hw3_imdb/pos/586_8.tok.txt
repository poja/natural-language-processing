a delight from start to finish.if you do n't like the muppets , then i just have to feel sorry for you .
this terrific film does n't simply cash in on the muppets ' popularity -- it 's a well-conceived and well-written film in its own right .
it 's got great songs , and it has that thread of wistful melancholy that was always present in jim henson 's creations and which is most personified in the character of kermit the frog .
i always responded to this as a kid , and it 's what makes the muppets still enjoyable to me as an adult when other material aimed at children drives me crazy.a huge cast of big names appearing in cameos makes this film feel like a kiddie-sized version of `` around the world in 80 days , '' except that it 's about 80 times better.grade : a
