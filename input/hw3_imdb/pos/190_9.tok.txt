fabulous cinematography from sergei urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work .
the opening scenes are as if one is leafing through some master photographer 's album and as the story begins to unfold we are swept away with both the events depicted and the beautiful look .
all is well shot but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking .
difficult to describe without 'spoiling ' but suffice to say one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady left behind and her lover 's brother are at odds as the sirens whine and the windows shatter .
another superimposes a swirling staircase and a spinning shot of tree tops and even develops into a fantasy sequence .
soviet film making of the highest order .
