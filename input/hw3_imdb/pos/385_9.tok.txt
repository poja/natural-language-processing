in strangers on a train , it 's obvious from the start that playboy wastrel robert walker has singled out farley granger as an unwilling accomplice to a pair of murders .
granger 's a semi-public figure , he 's a tennis pro , but not an especially high one .
high enough however for him to know that granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry ruth roman.so when they meet as complete strangers on a train one afternoon , walker knows enough that granger will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them , complete strangers , did commit homicide on parties that the other would be convenienced by their demise .
though granger is repulsed by the idea , one of the beautiful things about this film , is that you can see in the performance he gives that granger just might submit to temptation.in fact when walker kills laura elliot , granger 's wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man , he expects that granger will in turn murder walker 's father so that walker can inherit his estate .
today walker would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at that.alfred hitchcock directed walker to his career role , ironically in his last complete film .
walker died the following year with most of my son john finished .
hitchcock does not do too bad by farley granger either .
of course when granger does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him , the tension .
strangers on a train is also characterized by great editing , first in the tennis match in which granger has to finish the match and waylay walker before he plants evidence convicting granger at the crime scene .
and also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between walker and granger.strangers on a train is hitchcock at his best , it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing .
