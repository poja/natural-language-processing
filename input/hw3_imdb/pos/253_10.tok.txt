when i saw this film , it reminded me of all the greatest dreams i had ( mostly filled with robots ) i can relate to eledore 's problems and i have a similarity to shiro , and this is a great film to watch ( if you 're a goth who is bitter and eccentric like me ! )
.
all in all , watch it before it 's out of print !
