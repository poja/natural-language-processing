i watched this movie with my mother .
she is 81 yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot .
she even acknowledges this .
i do n't think she really understood what was happening , she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty .
scary .
i felt for this child and his family .
what torture they went through and remained faithful .
that is true faith .
back to the movie .
i was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude .
i am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case .
it was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that cared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him .
i could tell when one the cops was lying .
he would not look the defender in the eyes .
his eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions .
it is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of his skin .
i read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men .
they were finally found guilty after many years .
i ca n't remember the title , but it was the same premise .
whites doing whatever they want with blacks .
i am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time , if not forever .
i pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white .
no comment from her .
i want to commend the director and producer of this film .
i feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project .
i am an avid viewer of indy films .
i feel that they are well written and have substance .
i am pleased that i happened to grab this movie on the shelf .
i felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly i feel about the film and the prejudice that continues to exist in our modern society .
