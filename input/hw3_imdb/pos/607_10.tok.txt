this film is about aging geisha in post war tokyo .
okin , played by the incredible haruko sugimara , lends money to two other ex geisha , tamae ( chikako hosokawa ) and otomi ( yuko mochizuki ) and they resent the way she is somewhat smug about it .
tamae has a son , otomi a daughter , who during the film announce they 're leaving them while okin , never a mother , gets visits from two men in her past who , it turns out , just want money from her .
its a compelling tale of what choices you make , what you do to get through life and who you 're responsible and beholden to .
haruko sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country and she plays the mostly unyielding , less than compassionate okin with an air of superiority that makes you not like her , but at the same time almost envy her .
at a time when great films were made by ozu , mizoguchi , kinoshita and kurosawa , amongst others , mr. naruse is right up there with him .
if you have a region free dvd player , you should attempt to find the two naruse box sets released in england .
i think this film was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant .
that they are really not makes this film a veritable masterpiece .
