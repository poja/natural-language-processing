darling lili is fantastic !
its by far one my favorite films !
it certainly did n't deserve the poor reviews it received .
julie andrews , playing the title role of lili smith ( schmidt ) is the best part of the whole movie .
she is entrancing and spectacular !
as julie andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far , i was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is .
this movie is just ... great ( i 'm running out of adjectives ! )
, it 's magnificent , marvellous , amazing , funny , terribly romantic , sad , and just an all-out thrill and its all thanks to dame julie andrews !
and to her husband , director blake edwards .
oh , yeah rock hudson was ok , too : ) julie andrews is the beautiful and well-loved singer , lili smith .
rock hudson portrays major larabee , who quickly falls for lili , and she with him .
but their affair was not coincedental .
there meeting was planned by the german government ( i 'm not sure if that 's exactly what you 'd call them , but you get the point ) , because the warm , happy , singing entertainer lili is actually a german spy .
lili is told to seduce major larabee in order to get information of the new top secret opertaion ( later know as `` crepe suzette '' ) .
though lili is on a solemn mission , she falls in love with bill ( major larabee ) , for real , making her original quest challenging .
but lili pulls through and completes er task , after she finds out something that is not really true about bill .
the ending will remain unsaid by me as it is wonderfully layed out .
if anything , you 'll thoroughly enjoy this movie , i most certainly did !
