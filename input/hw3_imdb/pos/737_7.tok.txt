widely known as `` do n't look in the basement '' - this is pure 70s horror , b-movie goodness that could actually pass as the genre 's version of `` one flew over the cuckoo 's nest '' .
though the movie seems to go nowhere throughout the first hour+ of it 's runtime , i enjoyed this particular batch of quirky crazies and their various personalities and deficiencies - such as the former army sergeant , a chick obsessed with caring for a plastic doll , a lovable man-child , and a loony nymph .
after their head-doctor is murdered by a patient , a small sanitarium hires a new nurse onto their under-staffed facility , who becomes immersed in the resident 's different `` ticks '' and outbursts .
things gradually become stranger , however , when patients start acting far more abnormal than usual ... you never really know , or care , where the movie is going , 'cause it still entertains up until it 's completely whacked-out ending !
several of the `` twists '' felt a little too forced and i could have used a tad more blood , but i really dug this much too under-rated blend of humor and horror .
