victor mature , as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper , may be on the poster , but robert preston as a failed union colonel who led his men to get `` cut to ribbons '' by confederate artillery at shiloh , and is sent to a fort in oregon for his incompetence , has the most interesting part , married to a young and hard to recognize at first anne bancroft .
the uncivilized mature lusts for the colonel 's wife , giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another man 's wife at one point by james whitmore who plays mature 's older and wiser mountain man father figure .
directed by anthony mann , this film is lost among his more famous westerns with james stewart , but even so you really do n't need the indian menace to make this a film worth seeing , although preston gets to prove his bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the indians under submission , in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a rout .
