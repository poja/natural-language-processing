he 's not your conventional cab driver.this guys got issues .
with his wife , with his son , a priest , all his fares , his ex-partner and most of all himself .
and the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it .
so we have to keep watching to find out more about his past.the idea may not be original but david morse makes it so .
i think this is a great show , and i hope people catch-on before the season 's over .
watch this show !
