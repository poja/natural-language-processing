i always loved this film .
the music , story and the action .
i especially love the opening and closing of the film .
the music stayed with me throughout the years .
the wwi plane battles were great and the comedy is typical blake edwards .
slaptick is his forte ' after all .
julie 's singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen .
the sets and the scenes are wonderful .
the characters are appealing .
i loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and julie 's singing to them .
i wish she sang to me in vietnam .
i also enjoyed the old cars from the period and the wwi music.i was glad when the dvd arrived .
now i can whistle in the dark watching it again and again .
