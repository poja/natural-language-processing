young , ambitious nurse ms. charlotee ( rosie holotik ) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the middle of nowhere .
during the course of 3 days , she encounters strange happenings , even a patient in her bedroom watching her , yet she still stays .
the mental patients are all a little eye rolling ( espically by the judge ) , but my favorite was the old crazy biddy ( rhea macadams ) .
the storyline is okay at best , and the acting is surprisingly alright , but after awhile it 's gets to be a little much .
but , still it 's fun , quirky , strange , and original.note : the thing inside the basement is hardly horrifying , so the title is a little bananas .
