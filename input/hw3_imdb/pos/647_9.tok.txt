meant to be some sort of a social commentary about the way that our lives were spinning out of control in the 1970 's , this movie plays more like something mr. schlesinger threw together after having a bad day on the freeway .
a mish mash of snippets about the nuts encountered along the freeway in florida , and along the freeway of life , the cast is mostly wasted and probably ended up on the cutting room floor .
the problem is that what did n't end up on the cutting room floor probably should have !
now available on dvd , it 's kinda fun to see a comedy that would have cost $ 100 million to produce had it been made in 2004. it rolls along and is n't too difficult to sit through , and , strangely enough , in 2004 we 're all still pretty much justhopping in our cars and going faster and faster , heading nowhere .
