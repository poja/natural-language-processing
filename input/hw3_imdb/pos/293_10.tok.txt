i would like to submit the following goof.during the bridge scene , soldiers are seen wading out in the river , asking to be taken away and seeking to escape .
some of the soldiers approach captain willard 's boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases .
soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone .
they have duffel bags , packs and footlockers but not suitcases .
the use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping .
additionally , if you look closely , you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water .
this is probably a very good indication that it is empty , otherwise it would sink .
