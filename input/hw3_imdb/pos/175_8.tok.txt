interesting cartoon , included on the dvd of `` the lost skeleton of cadavra '' .
i especially like the way the color was used in the background art -- very artistic for columbia , whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget ( and the results looked like it ! )
i do wonder , however , how a certain ... um , finger gesture ... ever got past the censors .
granted , the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in 1937 than it is today .
you 'd think someone besides the animators would have noticed , though -- especially since it 's seen three times in the scene in question !
and based on the context , i suspect that its inclusion was intentional , something the animators slipped in just to see if the censors would notice !
