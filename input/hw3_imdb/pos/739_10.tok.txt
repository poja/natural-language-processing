although it is n't mentioned very often , `` do n't look in the basement '' is a very interesting film and is definitely worth a watch .
the story follows a young nurse , charlotte beale , who is hired at stephen 's sanitarium to replace dr. stephens , after he is murdered by a patient .
many patients begin to torment miss beale , and her boss , dr. geraldine masters , acts as if she 's hiding something ... this movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up caring about , and have sympathy for during the climax , which does n't happen very often in horror films .
the musical score is great and is reminiscent of `` dark shadows , '' the performance from rosie holotik , rhea mcadams , and bill mcghee are all great , the story is very intriguing with a great twist ending .
this movie has a campy atmosphere around it that no other film i have ever seen has been able to capture .
many horror fans have never seen or even heard of this film which is really unfortunate because it could have been a horror classic .
`` do n't look in the basement '' is definitely worth watching for all fans of 1970s drive-in films .
