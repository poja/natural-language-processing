the first feature-length adventure of jim henson 's beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as kermit the frog leaves his carefree , swampy surroundings for the bright lights ( egged on by stranded hollywood agent dom deluise who overheard him singing ) ; on the way , he meets fozzie bear ( a pitiful stand-up comedian at james coburn 's el sleazo caf√© who has telly savalas for a bouncer and madeline kahn a patron ! )
, the piano-playing dog rowlf , bestial drummer animal and his laid-back , funky band , egomaniacal beauty queen miss piggy ( in a ceremony presided over by elliott gould and edgar bergen ) , etc .
all the while , kermit et al are pursued by frogleg burger magnate charles durning and reluctant acolyte austin pendleton , sold cars , ice cream and balloons to by , respectively , milton berle , bob hope and richard pryor , served food by insolent waiter steve martin , nearly brainwashed by mad german scientist mel brooks and , finally , land an audition in the offices of movie mogul orson welles ( who has cloris leachman for a secretary ) !
the pleasant song score comes courtesy of paul williams who also makes an appearance as the resident pianist at el sleazo 's .
for the record , i have recently acquired four of the subsequent muppet movies and should be watching them in the weeks to come when their turn falls due .
