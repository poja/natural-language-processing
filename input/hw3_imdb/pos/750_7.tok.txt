i personally have a soft spot for horror films that are set in hospitals and asylums so i had a good feeling about watching this `` do n't look in the basement '' , even though its reputation is doubtful .
well , turned out i was right !
this is great , trashy entertainment with a couple of efficient shocks and delightfully absurd characters .
you have to , of course , look beyond the poor productions values and the completely illogical plot but , if you manage to do that ( and if you 're a fan of this type of horror , that 's an essential quality ) , you 'll be rewarded with an outrageous `` video-nasty '' in which blood and insanity form the main elements .
the young and cute nurse charlotte arrives at a remote sanitarium where she 's supposed to start her new job .
she finds out that the doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and the replacement doctor-in-charge masters seems reluctant to accept the new arrival .
the life inside the sanitarium is rather peculiar , with the patients running around free and every door is kept unlocked .
after a whole series of bizarre events , charlotte discovers the horrific secrets that the institution hides ... .
the opening 10 minutes ( pre-credits ) are great and so is the completely deranged climax .
everything in between is pretty much without surprise or tension but you patiently wait because you just feel that the finale will be wild fun .
the asylum 's patients are textbook lunatics , but i love them nevertheless .
some of my favorites include the former judge ( who still talks exclusively in legal terms ) , the suspicious army-sargeant and the mad-raving old lady .
`` do n't look in the basement '' is great low-brained fun , especially recommended to fans of 70 's trash-cinema , sick puppies and other types of scum .
the lunatics have taken over the asylum , yeah !
