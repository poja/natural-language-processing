this movie was fun !
especially if your between 8 and 15. frankie muniz and amanda bynes make a believable team of 8th graders getting back at an adult who really deserves it .
paul giamatti makes a great adult who you really want to 'get ' .
my 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it .
parents : no really bad words or any sex to worry about .
recommend it for the 'right ' crowd .
