i saw this film purely by chance .
it was shown very late , or more correctly very early one morning on television .
i had woken up and was having trouble getting to sleep and this film came on.it deals with a subject covered many times elsewhere ( it certainly is n't as good as educating rita , despite a couple of additional twists ) and has a very predictable ending.despite its very obvious shortcomings i did enjoy the film and this was thanks to the acting of some of its players rather than the story or the piece as a whole.i am a big fan of sam neil and have seen him in many different films including : dead calm ; the piano ; sirens ; children of the revolution ; event horizon ; bicentennial man and the ubiquitous jurassic park .
he was very good but he could have played this part with his eyes shut.some of the acting was , in my opinion , dreadful rose byrne for example and some of the elusions were rather heavy handed ( all the board woman in empty lives all dressed totally in white for example ) .however , two actors ( who i had n't , or do n't remember , seen before ) impressed me a lot sin√©ad cusackn as frances ( frank ) kennedy , and especially matthew newton as her son david .
he , in particular , was very convincing and i would like to see a lot more of him .
