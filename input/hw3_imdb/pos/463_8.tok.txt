i just saw this film at the sidewalk film festival in birmingham , al , which was actually a really fun festival , and was blown away by it .
it was the best movie i saw all day by a long shot .
a school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together .
it 's an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality .
story stems from real life occurrences , ripped straight from the headlines .
raw , blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end .
the film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity .
definitely not suitable for kids .
too depressing for some people 's tastes .
definitely worth checking out in my opinion though .
