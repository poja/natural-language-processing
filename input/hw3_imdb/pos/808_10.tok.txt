david suchet , ( poirot ) , '' foolproof '' , '03 , gave an outstanding performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said .
if he had a cocktail , he always had a napkin to blot the excess on his mouth with unbelievable perfection !
you could just view the expressions on the detective 's face and see that he never missed an item of importance in the suspects behavior .
the beautiful falls colors through out the english countryside was simply breath taking .
megan dodds , `` bait '' ,2000 , gave an outstanding performance as a very sexy , wild woman who was able to keep very important secrets away from mr. poirot .
a very enjoyable film if you really like the acting of david suchet as mr. poirot !
