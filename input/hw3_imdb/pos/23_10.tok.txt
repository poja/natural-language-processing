anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will lovethis film .
taken from ronald 'taking sides ' harwood , it 's a funnyand ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between twovery 'actorly ' types .
albert finney is sublime as the despoticshakespearean actor who barely notices the world war ragingaround him , so intent is he on the crumbling fortunes of his theatrecompany and his own psychological and emotional breakdown.tom courtenay is matchless as norman , the 'dresser ' of the title , whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless.really a must see .
