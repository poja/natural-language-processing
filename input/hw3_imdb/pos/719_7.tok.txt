to summerize this movie : nice for tv but too small for the theatre .
i enjoyed watching this movie at home but i wont watch it a second time .
the concept is good , but what ends up in the movie is just a summary .
the end had a 'nice ' twist but is still unsatisfying .
maybe it was the intention of the director but it was n't worked out like a it should be .
but then again , it 's an ok kind of movie .
