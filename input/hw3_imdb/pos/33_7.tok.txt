lackawanna blues is a drama through and through .
it details the life of a strong woman by the name of rachel crosby ( s. epatha merkerson ) .
rachel is referred to as nanny by all who know her , but she could have just as easily been called wonder woman .
she epitomized strength , will power , confidence and resolve .
she owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject .
her tenants consisted of a lesbian , a psychotic war veteran , an amputee , and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary .
each successive event rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly .
she was n't a dictator devoid of compassion , but in fact she was quite the opposite .
she displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to over-extend herself.merkerson did a good job , but i believe this role was right up her alley anyway .
the movie had an even keel never straying from rachel .
there were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected .
nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than rachel herself .
