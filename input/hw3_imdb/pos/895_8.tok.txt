laura gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to africa for a photo shoot .
there she is met by a couple and other swinging couples .
they all stay at this huge , very touristy hotel with a gigantic swimming pool .
one night they have a pool party complete with `` real live '' native dancers .
it 's very un-politically correct and very kitschy .
later , emanuelle finally has her photo shoot , which turns out to be in one of those drive-through , stay-in-your-car safaris ( albeit the photography is gorgeous ) .
throughout the film , emanuelle is going after every man she meets .
the photography is very well done in this film .
there are scenes with cascading waterfalls , galloping giraffes and ancient ruins .
the film is worth seeing for the soundtrack by nico fidenco alone .
