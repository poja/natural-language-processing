as muppet movies go , this is easily and clearly the best .
it features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age , a solid script , and some great disneyesque songs , and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of henson 's talent .
the story is basic , and the jokes are many-leveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed , without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirable.this is simply fun , but it is also a well made , well written , beautifully endearing classic.it rates an 8.9/10 from ... the fiend : .
