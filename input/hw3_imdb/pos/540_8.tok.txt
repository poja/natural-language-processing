i was laying in bed , flicking through the channels ... and boy do i have channels ... 500 of them .
with over 70 movie channels , i probably watch a movie on cable , once or twice a month ... dvd has spolied me.anyway , i 'm flicking through and i come to this movie and because i see natilie portman , i take interest .
110 minutes later i am still interested .
how could this be ?
when i first saw the previews to this movie in the theater i remember making fun of it .
i never thought i 'd watch it ... nevermind like it.the story is based on a book , and you can tell .
the movie is very episodic , andit 's not like the movie has a great plot , it just sucks you in .
may-be its that performances that do it .
i 'm pretty sure in must have been.this movie was good for no reason ... peter 's movie rating ( out of 10 ) : 7
