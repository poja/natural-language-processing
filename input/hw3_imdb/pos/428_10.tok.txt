`` hey , i did n't order no cab ! ''
`` yeah , well you got one ... '' what can i say about hack ... what a man among men .
he was a heartened ex-cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold .
if you were able to ( and fortunately for america 's tv viewers ... one person per week was ) penetrate the cold , hard surface of hack 's exterior , you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice .
the show was superb , i laughed , i cried , i smiled ... all in the same episode .
my arms would break out in goosebumps when our dear friend hack would exit his cab in another dark alley ... with nothing more than his fists ... ready to avenge a wronged civilian .
a smile would break out on my face when the screen showed me a criminal in a dark alley 's facial expressions when the taxi of justice 's headlights illuminated upon his face .
week after week i canceled my duties as president of the klingon association to bask in the warmth glow of hack 's brilliance .
i have never seen a better show , and i mourned the loss of one of america 's greatest treasures when the show was canceled .
in other hack-related news , i would like to announce to the world that my wife and i are expecting hack koen to come into the world in about three weeks .
