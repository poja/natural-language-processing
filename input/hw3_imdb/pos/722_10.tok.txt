i watched this film not knowing anything about it .
i had presumed it was a sci-fi b movie of some sort .
how wrong i was .
the plot is enthralling and intelligent , the cast are all charismatic and the whole film just makes you think for a change .
some of the riddles stumped me completely but in the end the answers were rather simple .
i am quite baffled at the low scoring of this film as i thought it was quite unusual .
if you liked the film se7en ( seven ) with brad pit or the matrix then you will like this .
there is no major special effects or fancy gimmickry here at all .
it is all about the plot , about building the characters and building an atmosphere .
it is a film however than ultimately provides no answers which may irk some people but i thought the ending was great .
i am still not sure if the film is based on an true story or not ... ... .
