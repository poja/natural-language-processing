i watched this expecting to see the usual british stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humour .
it was more like eastenders goes to sea than in which we serve .
the scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the ship 's company ( well at least based on my service in the 1970s ) .
some of the throwaway lines are very witty ( `` i 'm not joining the band of hope just to please some greasy fish fryer ! )
.
my only complaint is that they did n't show what happened to the irish coxswain and his bride to be , or the tattooed po and his `` i love arabella '' tattoo !
