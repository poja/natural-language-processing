`` rouge '' is part of a trilogy , but very much stands on its own .
it is n't a sequel of any sort .
the very end , which i wo n't divulge , ties the three films together , but not seeing the other two does n't make it too confusing .
this film amazes me because it is so spare , so subtle and simple , but is as effective , emotionally and intellectually , as any big-budget spectacle or all-star melodrama .
kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny .
both themes are loosely woven together in the story .
the film is very much a puzzle , but the message is pretty straightforward : everything happens for a reason .
love is in all of our destinies as long as we open ourselves to it .
the title , `` red '' refers to the french flag , where red represents `` fraternity , '' or brotherhood .
the color dominates the visuals of the movie .
i tend to think of it as representing love or passion , or the blood of life .
it 's great when a film allows the freedom to do that ; )
