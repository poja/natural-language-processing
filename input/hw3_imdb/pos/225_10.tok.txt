i watched this series after i had seen the naked gun films .
i found it much better than the films , and i thought the films were great !
this series literally glues you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun , sight gag , or funny situation ( the all night wicker place , club flamingo ) .
i do n't think i 've ever laughed as hard at a tv series in my life , even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes .
i think its a shame that only six episodes were produced , but i agree that the writers would be very hard pressed to maintain this level of comedy for any more episodes .
overall , the series is a must see for those who like puns , bad jokes , and slapstick sight-gags .
