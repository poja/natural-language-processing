me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a friday night before going to the pub .
it was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time .
it is one of the best comedies i have ever watched if not the best .
david jason was brilliant and was compared many times to buster keaton with his clever stunts that were pulled off so believably .
i wish i could get hold of the series on dvd to watch again .
he had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions .
he is an accomplished `` trip and fall guy '' and i remember watching a trailer once where he showed people how to do this professionally .
certainly he is the one to teach people this art .
he only showed glimpses of it in other programs he did .
pshaw , this program shows how multi talented he is .
i am lost as to why david jason vetoed another series being made , as for my mind it was one of the best things he has ever done and i 've been a fan of his since he did this series .
it is said he did not like it because it showed the rawness of his early career .
well to my mind , that might possibly have been the right decision when he took it , but now his career has progressed so far , i believe this would be a good time for him to do another series showing him looking back on his `` secret life '' full of blunders that he does not see .
