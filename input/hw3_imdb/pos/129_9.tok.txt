this intelligent , moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition ( reminds me of william faulkner 's novels ) .the characters all feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are expected to assume , and seek for a way to live within those roles rather than throw them off altogether .
but as the story develops the two wives , trapped in loveless marriages , draw together .
drawing on the strength of their friendship and love , they give each other the courage to abandon their roles.they have found that living within their traditions is no life at all , it is a sort of living death : without passion , without true connection to others , without fulfillment .
although they know there will be a price to be paid for their rebellion and freedom , it is a price much less dear than the sacrifice called for by a comfortable , predictable existence.the screenplay is wonderful , the acting marvelous .
near perfect !
