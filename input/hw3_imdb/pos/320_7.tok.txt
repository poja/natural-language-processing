touching bollywood epic melodrama about a 10 year-old girl who finds out that she 's adopted , and is determined to find her birth mother .
the film 's major success is the performance of p.s .
keerthana , who plays the girl .
the first half of the film is very good .
there are a few really good songs , too , especially the number that introduces the protagonist .
unfortunately , the film 's second half , which takes place in war-torn sri lanka , feels like an entirely different , and disappointing movie .
it 's big on explosions and special effects , with sri lankan soldiers and rebels dodging grenades , running from fireballs , and being yanked by stunt wires .
all the film can offer as insight are cheap platitudes like , `` some day there must come peace '' and `` perhaps the children will find a way '' .
the final sequence , where the daughter and mother are reunited , is good , but so over-the-top with the music and a well-timed downpour that it feels like a cheat .
i know , i know , it 's all in the style of bollywood .
but this is a story where big moments simply detract from the simple , powerful central story .
bollywood could certainly use a little restraint at times , too .
