charlotte beal arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full-time nurse there .
she is confronted with a motley group of crazies and a seemingly crazier supervisor .
is dr. masters all she seems to be ?
do n't look in the basement is one of the best low-budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me .
the acting is excellent , my favorite performance being by betty chandler as allyson the nymphomaniac .
the chills just jump right off the screen .
you probably wo n't have to say `` it 's only a movie , it 's only a movie '' , it is n't that scary , but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre , which i do .
it is very hard to make a creepy film on a low budget and few actually succeed .
axe is another cheap film that is looked down upon .
maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that does n't have excellent effects and/or is n't considered a classic does n't have a chance with an audience .
but i think that after people see this movie , they will see how important the low-budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish .
