a very delightful bit of filmwork that should have had wider distribution .
ian mcshane is right at home playing the soul loving dj who gets canned because he wo n't `` go along with the program `` and sets out to let the world know what they 're missing .
the supporting cast is great as well , and the music is the `` soul '' of the film .
i just wish that the film would be released so that i could get a copy of this for my film library .
