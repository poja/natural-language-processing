i did n't see this movie until it appeared on television because i was doubtful about comic flicks .
ever since the `` batman '' series , `` spawn , '' `` judge dredd , '' and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs , i dodged everything at all cost .
i would question in my mind , `` why ca n't someone make a movie that is rated r and stays true to the story , how difficult is that ? ''
and finally my prayers have been answered with blade .
this movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence , blood , martial arts , weapons , fire , the good against evil , etc .
yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies , and most of them have bombed .
but not blade , the movie was filmed just right , not going overboard , delivering a good length and never a dull moment .
blade ii is cool , but not as cool as the first .
blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks i 've seen in a long time .
