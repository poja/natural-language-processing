this movie won a special award at cannes for its acting and it 's not difficult to see why .
( a few spoilers - but for the ending , you 'll have to watch the movie ! )
a simple story - in moscow on the eve of war between russia and germany in ww ii veronika ( tatiana samoilova ) is in love with boris ( aleksei batalov ) but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army .
boris leaves for the front before veronika can tell him she loves him .
boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to veronika or his family .
mark , boris ' cousin , rapes veronika who feels obligated to marry him .
degraded and demeaned by the cowardly mark , veronika clings to the hope that someday boris will return .
superb camera-work and wonderful set pieces by director kalatozov .
( for anyone interested in film technique another movie by kalatozov , i am cuba , has at least two superb set pieces - one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of havana , rises two stories to a cigar factory , tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long , long avenue - all without a cut . )
superb acting , particularly by samoilova and vasili merkuryev ( as boris ' uncle ) that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement .
a devastatingly romantic movie with a heart-stopping performance by samoilova .
( this movie is frequently linked with the other russian classic ballad of a soldier . )
