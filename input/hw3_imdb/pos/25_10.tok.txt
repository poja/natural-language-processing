this is a movie that deserves another look -- if you have n't seen it for a while , or a first look -- if you were too young when it came out ( 1983 ) .
based on a play by the same name , it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring shakespearean repertory company in england during world war ii .
it deals with his stress of trying to perform a shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors -- the young , able bodied ones being taken for military service .
it also deals with his relationship with various members of his company , especially with his dresser .
so far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth .
while tragic overall , the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout .
the two male leads both received oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so .
i strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama , theater -- especially shakespeare , or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity .
the backstage goings-on make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers .
