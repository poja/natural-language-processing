blade is a fantastic action/thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and wesley snipes delivers what i would say to be his best performance yet.this film has everything that you would ask for in an action/thriller , it has plenty of blood , guts and gore , a twisted , disturbed bad buy , moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twists.their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects , wesley snipes fighting movement is fantastic.this film is in my opinion a must see , wesley snipes cool , solid appearance makes this film and i ca n't wait for the sequel 'blade 2 ' being released next year.my imdb rating - 9 out of 10
