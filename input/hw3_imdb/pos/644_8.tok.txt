i just finished this movie and my only comment is `` oh !
wow ! ''
.
jennifer beals is ok as the fiancee , but yancy butler as the female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite !
having watched her in witchblade , i was not prepared for the pure unadulterated sensuality and raw sexual excitement she launches onto the screen.i got ta see this movie again ... .if only for yancy butler as corrinne !
