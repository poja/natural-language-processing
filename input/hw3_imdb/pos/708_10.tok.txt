the first time i saw this film i was a kid .
i was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters i saw it on network tv .
i remember watching it alone and crying afterward .
it was only the second film to illicit that response ( rocky was the first ) and there have n't been many since .
i ca n't say why exactly ; larry `` rain '' murphy did n't deserve to win any more that rocky balboa or anyone else .
i know i admired murphy , not so much for what he did , but for the way he did his time .
stoic .
he did n't need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity .
he ran because he could .
he needed no other reason .
i have a rule today , that when i see this film late at night on cable television ( the only time most will come across it ) i must watch , no matter what i have to do the next morning .
fortunately it does n't play often like shawshank redemption or other favorites , so i still get plenty of sleep and i never tire of the story of one man 's unrepentant imprisonment and personal victory .
