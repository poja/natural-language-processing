the main attraction of anywhere but here is the superb performance of natalie portman .
she gave her rather thankless character a lot of much-appreciated emotional depth .
susan sarandon , a fine actress , is suitably sincere as the mother figure .
i thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable , a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script .
i am not saying the script was bad in any way , i am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times .
i do n't think it was the script writer 's fault .
the film did suffer from being overlong , and became sometimes unfocused in the longer scenes .
the film does look beautiful , with some good direction and excellent performances .
all in all , watchable certainly , but maybe more for an older audience .
7/10 bethany cox .
