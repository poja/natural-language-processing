in the `` goofs '' section for this film there 's a comment to the effect that there is a mistake in continuity where auguste 's car is seen to be parked in a different place from that seen in a previous shot in the same scene .
this is incorrect .
one of the views is from auguste 's flat , the other is from valentiné 's flat across the street .
the whole purpose of this segment is to show how valentiné and auguste - who may be made for each other - almost cross paths ( as happens several other times ) but never quite do so , until circumstances throw them together on the ferry at the end of the film .
( and here there is the implication that joseph has manipulated things so that auguste is on that ferry , having inspected valentiné 's ticket to see which sailing she is booked on . )
