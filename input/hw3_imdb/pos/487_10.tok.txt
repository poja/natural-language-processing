i grew up in winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday .
there are good and bad in every race , why make them all out to be bad ?
that goes for all races today .
john harper was an educated man , he graduated from high school , he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the reserve .
how do i know this ?
john harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school , and he kept in contact with us the year after graduation .
he was a kind and gentle soul , he could be fun loving and he could be serious when the times were right .
i was n't very old when he left our house , but i can still remember all the times he helped me with my homework when my own brother could n't be bothered .
he even taught grade 3 the year before he came to winnipeg .
none of this is mentioned in the movie , and the suicide of constable cross is an admission of guilt as far as i 'm concerned .
what happened to john is unforgivable , not only in the native community , but also in the white community .
not everyone in winnipeg think like the police do , i knew the person inside , and what he was like as a person , not an indian !
