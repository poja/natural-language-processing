a fantastic cinema experience .
i really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out .
there is nothing to add , except that is a terrible shame that sir albert finney still is n't accepted by the ampas ( american academy ) .
after roles in such films as tom jones , murder on the orient express , under the volcano ( to name only few - for these he was nominated for the oscar ) , the dresser is arguably his highlight , yet ... i know , oscars are just popularity contest , but if americans like british actors and actresses ( `` and the oscar goes to '' jeremy irons , daniel day-lewis , anthony hopkins , emma thompson , glenda jackson etc .
- and they all deserved the award ! )
, why they always left sir finney with empty hands ?
on the other hand , they gave it to john wayne and marisa tomei ( in cousin vinny ) .
i do n't know , should i laugh or cry.if you have seen the two leads in the dresser , you wo n't forget what is the art of acting .
watch this film and enjoy !
i recommend it to everyone who loves art.i give 9/10 for this excellent film ( 1 point missing for non-cinematic material , after all it is `` just '' a theater ) note : my criteria is much stronger than this on imdb ( 10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that should/could last forever ) .
