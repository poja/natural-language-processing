this film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70 's exploitation film , except it was done in the late 80 's for the direct to video market.you have a young couple in love , but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence .
when the boyfriend goes to jail , the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals , who are everyone in this movie except for the cops .
first she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord jim brown money , she becomes brown 's property .
then she 's basically enslaved in a military style crack house that the movie is named for.as if this is n't enough reason to see this movie , you also have anthony geary playing a seemingly conservative school guidance counselor , but he 's really a major crack dealer .
in a sleazy yet hilarious scene , he demands sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money for a fix .
in an earlier scene it was established that he is her counselor .
that scene and another where jim brown forces her to take a scalding hot shower because she stinks are hysterical .
lead actress cheryl kay was really good in this film .
tarantino , bring her back.it 's not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that tarantino is a major fan of this .
it has just the right blend of comedy , action , sex , romance , and yes a central message to stay away from drugs .
jim brown 's villainous turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great 80 's b villain , wings hauser in vice squad .
sometimes i think there should be a b movie oscars where performances like this could be acknowledged .
in the meantime let 's hope that the modern straight to dvd filmmakers learn learn to use this same type of tongue in cheek humor .
