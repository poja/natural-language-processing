saw the film at the hollywood film festival in oct '04 .
mark robertson took a huge chance writing an extremely difficult part for his first film and it paid off big in his casting of kelly overton .
i had a strong feeling she came from the theater so i looked her up here and ... surprise , i 'm right .
more hollywood actors should follow her lead , give up the expensive acting classes and get back to theater because only with that kind of training will you be prepared for a ride like this .
for all the great things i can say about the film and the director ( and there are many ) i just ca n't stop talking to people about kelly overton 's masterful performance .
we 'll be seeing a lot more of her work , no doubt .
congratulations to mark and kelly on a daring film .
get it out in the theaters so i can bring all the people i made want to see the film asap !
