good performances by jean paul belmondo as young proprietary of a cigarette company who seems determined to fall under the spell of a femme fatale and a wonderful catherine deneuve as suspect heroine .

loosely based on the novel titled'waltz into darkness ' by cornell woolrich ( rear window and screenwriter of alfred hitchcock hour ) who also was adapted in 'truffaut 's the bride wore black'.colorful cinematography by denys clerval ( stolen kisses ) and atmospheric musical score by antoine duhamel , truffaut 's usual musician.this is one of the best of his suspense movies along with ¨farenheit 451 and shoot the piano player¨ .
remade by an inferior version by michael christofer ( 2001 ) with antonio banderas , angelina jolie and jack thompson , full of erotic and lust scenes .
