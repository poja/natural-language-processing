lovely .
i just love the movie .
i want to see this movie because rupert grint is a fantastic actor .
his expressions are great , spectacular .
the movie was excellent .
julie walters it was perfect too .
i think that rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love .
rupert have a beautiful smile , a beautiful voice .
and a wonderful accent .
i think that the movie was great and was great see rupert in another thing but harry potter .
and its a very good actor , so it deserves that and more .
he just have a golden globe but probably it deserves an oscar academy award .
there are some actors that do not act very well but have a oscar anyway .
it does not matter .
but he is perfect , brilliant and beautiful
