i love just about everything the late al adamson directed in his long and varied career , but `` the possession of nurse sherri '' stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade-z schlockfests like `` horror of the blood monsters '' and `` dracula vs. frankenstein '' .
this film is actually scary !
am i saying that you 're going to jump out of your seat when you watch `` nurse sherri '' ?
no , of course not .
but this pastiche of elements from `` the exorcist '' , `` ruby '' , and `` carrie '' is one of those nice , eerie little horror movies common to the seventies .
you ca n't put your finger on what 's so spooky about it , but the film drips with atmosphere .
( and what an ending !
do n't worry , i wo n't spoil it for you . )
adamson and producer sam sherman really nailed it with this one , and it does n't matter whether `` nurse sherri '' was a calculated success or a happy accident .
jill jacobson is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader ( bill roy , who shines in his brief role ) .
geoffrey land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend .
there are some blaxploitative elements here ( profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in flicks , after all ) but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing .
`` nurse sherri '' was a poverty row production , and it shows at times ( sets , special effects , etc. )
.
still , the film has heart , mostly decent acting and direction , and some genuine chills .
sam sherman also saw fit to use harry lubin 's theme music for the late '50s/early '60s television series `` one step beyond '' in this film , which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere .
the dvd contains two significantly different cuts of the movie ( the early version features a lot of t & a that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff ) as well as the theatrical trailer , the tv spot , and a great commentary by sherman .
does anybody know whatever happened to bill roy , by the way ?
next to john carradine , he 's the best actor i 've ever seen in an al adamson film , and he plays the cult leader like he means it .
