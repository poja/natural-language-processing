well it might be a kid 's movie ... perhaps but i 'm not gon na let my kids from 9 watch it !
, so the one who say it is a kid movie hmm ?
!
, it is teenager movie i agree.. , so but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very good.. , so good that at the end nobody nows truth or lie.anyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story ... i think they writers mend a litlle lesson whit it ... ''the truth is never overated '' .
