i swear if i did ever tried cocaine i 'd be able to relate to this film perfectly .
its pace , as well as the dialog , churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads.there are great little elements that pop up through out the film , like how rob lowe 's character seems to always be loosing a shoe , or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path .
the story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless.the movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness .
this is one i think most could enjoy .
a few laugh-out-loud-even-if-you-are-alone moments ensure that i 'll certainly be watching this again .
