i enjoyed it .
there you go , i said it again .
i even bought this movie on dvd and enjoyed it a couple of more times .
call me old fashioned but i prefer movies like this to garbage like die hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving america .
van damme moves well for a guy of his age ( 47 i think ) , delivering kicks that reminds one of kickboxer .
if you like old school action and and explosions , this is the movie to watch .
this is one of van damme 's best works.van damme and steven seagal movies get released theatrically where i live so i never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen .
