one night i was listening to talk radio and they had leslie nielsen on the program .
he went on to explain why there were only 6 shows .
'with tv shows like mash you could go to the fridge to get a beer and as long as you heard what was going on you did n't miss anything .
but with police squad , you had to watch the show , with the sight gags you missed a whole lot if you did n't see them .
who could forget `` ... the part of town known as `` little italy '' ... '' with the coliseum in the background.even the movies relied heavily on the sight gags , but then again being in the theater you were a captive audience.leslie also said the one reason the show , movies and other movies like airplane were funny is because they did n't attempt to tell what was funny .
it was up to the viewer to get the jokes.well that 's just my 2 cents .
