with its ww2 timing , falling in and out of love , and easy on the eye kira , this is re-atonement .
this a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of ww2 .
poet dylan thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky blitz london and later in windy wales .
vera 's ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share .
an easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace .
would work well with french subtitles but then i may have been to too many art house movies lately .
