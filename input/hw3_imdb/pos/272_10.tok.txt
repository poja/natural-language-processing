the stepford children , besides being a very good made for tv movie , shows the very disturbing result of indoctrination .
it is quite a statement about how being made to act within the confines of what is considered `` good '' behavior can destroy whatever it is that makes a person unique and an individual .
i think that this is a movie that parents who want to maintain some semblance of the thought that loams within the hearts and minds of youngsters should watch with their children and discuss what the movie is saying .
i do n't know if that was in any way the intent of this movie but i have always been of the opinion that it is one of the best movie devices against the wish to have children conform to an unrealistic and domineering pretense of what is in the best interest of anyone other than that of the children themselves .
i hope to one day see this movie on dvd .
i am at the starting gate ... waiting .
