i 'm not sure what intrigues me about this movie so .
it is grainy , poorly written , bleached out , often ridiculous , and at many points mind numbingly dull ( the person i was watching it with fell asleep twice . )
and yet there is something in this film that fascinates me , though i am not sure what ; perhaps the character of sam , an enormous former patient who was lobotimized by the former head doctor and who is perpetually sucking on an ice pop ) , or the marvelously played head doctor ( i forget her name ) .anyway , watch it and form you 're own opinion ; it has one of the greatest endings i have seen in film .
