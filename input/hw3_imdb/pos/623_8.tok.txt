superbly crafted low-budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at , and plenty of ghoulish humour along the way as well.the cast play it very well , although richards ' self-centered movie director is a bit hard to take at times .
the tiny two-scene cameo by sir alec guinness , oozing menace as the crime czar of moscow , is simply the icing on the cake.well worth repeated viewing , but not on dark nights when you 're all alone !
