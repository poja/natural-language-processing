`` driving lessons '' sees two middle class quintessential british families meet head on , when grint 's character comes into contact with evee , ( walters ) , a slightly deranged out-of-touch actress with an ego .
grint betrays his overpowering , and over-christian mother , ( linney ) , and goes off travelling with evee to scotland , to accompany her on a trip to participate in a poetry reading , something she claims could be her last , due to an illness.grint 's portrayal of a caged youngster , brainwashed by an overbearing , and even hypocritical mother , is the masterpiece of this film .
his portrayal of a downtrodden teen in search of his true morals , and happiness , is captivating to watch unfold throughout .
the film is sharply shot , and well paced , with very few moments leaving you tired , an achievement , particularly considering the nature of the plot .
walters really grabs hold of her character with both hands , and successfully brings the audience to her side of things , emphasising linney 's ironic immorality throughout .
her role in `` driving lessons '' is enjoyable and memorable in every sense.the plot develops nicely , leaving the audience cheering on grint as he chases back to evee 's place during his lunch break during his stint at a local bookshop to apologise for his wrongdoings .
the values in the piece are continued and brought out thoroughly up until the final drag , in a very consistent way .
the overbearing , ( and relieving ) , main idea being that religion does n't lead to happiness , and certainly does n't lead to morality.the audience are left sympathising with the radical but lovable evee , with her and grint making an irresistible partnership on the big screen , transferred directly from their debut in the `` harry potter '' series .
charismatic and beautiful acting together with a tight and fact paced script make this a must-see this christmas .
