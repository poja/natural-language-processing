one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time .
bechard has a way of looking at things that is completely unique and this movie does not disappoint.this movie has you guessing throughout , and with the seemingly taboo topics addressed it keeps you glued to the screen .
there are no bad guys or good guys , bechard makes sure of that .
the characters are so perfectly complex you feel for each of them , you care about what they have been through.bechard 's use an attention to details is unmatched in this world of `` fast food movies '' and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable - you love the feeling it gives you.i have heard it said too often that there are no new stories to tell .
thank you gorman bechard for proving that false.run , do n't walk , to see this movie .
