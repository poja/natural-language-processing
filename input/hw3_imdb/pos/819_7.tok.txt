crack house ( 1989 ) was one of the few film during the 80 's that falls into this genre .
what 's supposed to be an anti-drug film turns out to be nothing more than some white-exploitation exercise in depravity .
there 's nothing wrong with that however .
the video presentation even has an anti-drug message from one of the stars of the show richard `` turncoat '' roundtree , the movie follows two young lovers in high school .
one of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl .
one of them get 's turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his ex-friends .
jim brown appears as the movie 's `` mister big '' , he 's one bad dude who still can punk-out anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his hoes and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word .
luke from general hospital makes a guest star spot as well.if you like hard edge sleaze then this movie 's for you .
sadly , hollywood does n't make these any more and when they do , it 's neither exploitative nor entertaining.recommended for sleaze fans .
