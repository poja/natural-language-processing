very literate , intelligent drama about a group of international travelers held virtual prisoners in the hungary of 1956 by invading russian communist regime .
kerr and robards play lovers , she a british baroness , he a hungarian freedom fighter trying to do his bit for his country .
other new york theater stars of the period anne jackson & e g marshall play an american couple traveling with their two young sons , including ronny howard in his screen debut .
jackson 's character is hugely pregnant and not anxious to give birth in a soon-to-be communist country ; she gives an impassioned plea in the third act of this film which presages the naturalistic acting styles we 've come to know today from redgrave , fonda , & streep .
leading the pack of soviet wolves is yul brynner , magnificent as a commandant and at his sexiest since he played opposite kerr in `` the king and i '' .
he is mean and nasty and terribly conflicted by his attraction to the lovely , patrician , & heroic kerr .
this is one of the great transition films of the latter part of the golden era of american film .
do not miss it .
