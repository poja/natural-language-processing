after seeing big fat liar , i think jason learned a lot more .
when he told the truth about marty stealing his story , it was like the boy who cried wolf .
people heard him , but they did n't believe him .
nobody did anything to help him .
besides , not only marty 's movies stink , so does his advice .
the truth is not overrated .
i am so glad he got exposed for what he really is .
everyone found out that he stole from that boy , including his parents .
not only he stole from that boy and lied about it , he gave them someone else 's work and tried to call it his own , which is plagiarism .
does n't he know that it is illegal to plagiarize someone 's idea ?
another reason why he got fired .
he is not trustworthy .
he 's a liar , a cheat , a thief , a crook , and a plagiarist .
you got that marty ?
you 're a plagiarist .
plus , you got everything that you deserved .
