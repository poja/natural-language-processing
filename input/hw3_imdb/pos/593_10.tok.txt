who does n't remember the muppet movie ?
?
?
kermit the frog is now an american culture icon .
what child does n't appeal to this character ?
as the first actual muppet film , the movie simply called , the muppet movie did very well .
kermit takes a hollywood agent 's advice and goes out of his home swamp to respond to the ad .
along the way he meets up with a pig , a bear , chickens a rock band and a few other quality puppets .
watch for dozens of cameo appearances like madaline kahn , steve martian , richard pryor , mel brooks and several more .
i grew up watching this movie and i loved it .
