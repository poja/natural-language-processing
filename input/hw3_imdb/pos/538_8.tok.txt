susan sarandon .
she made this movie for me .
i 've never appreciated her acting more than as i did in this movie .
she really acted as though she were adele august .
i can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who 's truly believable .
natalie portman as ann august helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie .
the movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral.i gave this movie an eight rating , but susan received a ten from me because of her performance .
as far as relationship movies go , beaches and terms of endearment had a greater impact on me than this movie , but i highly recommend it .
