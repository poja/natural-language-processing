deepa mehta 's `` fire '' is groundbreaking , bold , and artistic .
a masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative , upper middle class indian households , this is a film no one should miss .
shabana azmi and nandita das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible .
a.r .
rahman 's music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film .
mehta uses rahman 's score and together , they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around radha and sita whenever they look to each other for support .
this film is not about lesbianism as many have branded it .
lesbianism is just a part of the film .
it is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film off calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning .
