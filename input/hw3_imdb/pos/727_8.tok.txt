a raw edgy thriller that aimed for great philosophical heights it could n't quite attain .
i did still enjoy the film immensely .
it had great elements of suspense , leaving me with that delightful spine chill i expect from thrillers , and it achieved this purely psychologically , without resorting to escalating blood and gore .
the soundtrack and setting added to the suspense perfectly .
at times , it was a bit unpolished , particularly the acting , and character development .
it could only have been a better film if we had known more about the nightmares from the past the characters see when they close their eyes , and why they felt this desperate need to seek the `` answer '' that is so integral to the storyline .
after all they seemed to continue to seek it , despite knowing or at least having an inkling of what might happen when they found it .
i would recommend seeing this film if you are prepared to look beyond the grit to see the potential of a diamond in the rough .
