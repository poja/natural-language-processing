mute witness is a modest , yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves .
the film  written and directed entirely by anthony waller  is a tense , action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences .
no pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twists just straight to the point mystery .
mute witness handles about the vicious topic of `snuff'-movies and is effectively set in russia .
*** spoilers *** since the production costs are cheaper there , a us film crew temporarily moves to russia for shooting a horror film .
an old hangar is used as film location .
the female make-up artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out , she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff-movie !
she 's caught and tries to escape but , since she 's a mute , she ca n't cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly .
the girl 's life is in real danger now , since there 's a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they do n't want the witnesses to be alive *** end spoilers *** .
mute witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody .
some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end .
regarding the similar topic , i 'd say it 's definitely better than the more famous `8 mm ' , directed by joel schumacher and starring nicolas cage .
the acting in mute witness is n't great , but the leading actress ( who 's russian herself ) looks really cute .
sir alec guinness makes a special appearance , too .
and a very cool one , i may say .
surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares .
