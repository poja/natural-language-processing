what a wonderful film , filled with eccentric , unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast .
the director also did a great job keeping the story held together , getting those wonderful performances ( on not messing with them ) and using music ( and what wonderful music it is ) to great effect .
s. epatha in the lead role is great .
i had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is , and although i have enjoyed her on law and order , this really shows what she can do with a filled out , complex role .
macy gray is terrific , mos def , as usual , wonderful .
lou gossett , great .
jimmy smits , terrific , and does n't try to pull focus because he 's a star .
a true piece of ensemble acting .
rent it , enjoy it , groove to it , and treasure it .
something special .
