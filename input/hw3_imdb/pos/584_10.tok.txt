the muppet movie is an instant classic .
i remember the opening scene with the bird 's eye view of the swamp and kermit starting into ( in my opinion ) the most loved song in the history of songs .
at this point my mom would always sing along with kermit.watching this title as a young adult it makes me smile .
i can still sing along to my heart 's desire .
like many muppet films there are in jokes for adults that are ( in my opinion ) still funny today .
my favorite line of all time is actually from this film , it 's the last line spoken by my green , goggle eyed hero kermit `` life 's like a movie , write your own ending '' .
that 's what i intend to do !
thank you jim henson .
