working girl kitty ( sothern ) is engaged to bill ( kelly ) , who neglects her by working long hours at his garage in order to save money for their marriage .
after being stood up on her birthday , kitty goes on a double-date/blind date , where she meets department store heir bob hartwell ( hamilton ) .
she falls in love , but leaves him when his protestations of love appear to cover a desire for her to be his mistress , rather than his wife .
faithful bill rallies 'round to comfort her , and at last she gives in to his repeated requests to reinstate their engagement , pressured in part by bill 's support of her family after she loses her job .
when bob returns , however , convinced that he wants marriage after all , will kitty follow her heart or her conscience ?
this film was a lot better than i 'd expected it to be .
the character of bill at first comes off as the sort of loud comic irishman type that jack carson played so often .
but kelly ( and the script ) infuse the character with real compassion and love , and bill turns out to be the best person in the entire group .
viewers may find themselves rooting for him against the feckless hartwell !
the tone of the film wavers , however , between light-hearted romance and a much darker side , especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather horrific accident at bill 's garage.the cast is rounded out by the dependable jane darwell as kitty 's mother , an impish but not yet thoroughly obnoxious mickey rooney as kitty 's younger brother , and spencer charters as kitty 's ne'er-do-well father .
