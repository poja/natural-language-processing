i was n't expecting much out of this movie and i was slapped in the face .
julie walters , rupert grint , and laura linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie .
any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are , which is basically what this movie is about .
ben ( rupert grint ) does this when he meets retired actress evie ( julie walters ) and begins to express his ideas with words .
he slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward .
each and every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter 75 % of the time .
the film satisfies all , and i hope that soon it might be released in all us theatres , because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities .
it is a must see !
