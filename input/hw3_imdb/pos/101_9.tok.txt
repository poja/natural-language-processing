this is a very , very odd film ... one that is so odd it 's best you just see it for yourself .
the film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is !
you can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic -- finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self-importance .
additionally , he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life.later in the film , he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head .
oddly , this is only half-way through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life .
this is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature professor 's novels -- one that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say them.see this weird film -- it 's amazingly compelling and not like anything i 've ever seen before .
