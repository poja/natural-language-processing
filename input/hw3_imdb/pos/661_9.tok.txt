cheezy ?
yep .
poorly filmed ?
you betcha .
zero budget ?
they proudly claim it on their posters .
brilliant anyway ( or because of it ) ?
for sure.this movie celebrates ( and makes fun of ) everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre : characters with absolutely no depth , fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment ; teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent ; completely gratuitous nudity ; impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims ; slow moving zombies ; great one-liners ... and our hero even wears a michael jackson jacket !
this is not an all-out spoof like scary movie , but more a tribute film to the lost innocence of the 80s horror movies ... when being scared and grossed out could also be a fun , silly , sexy , and goofy good time !
