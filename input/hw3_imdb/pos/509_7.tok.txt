hope the summary line wo n't irritate you that much ( it 's a little homage to the chappelle show/charlie murphy , but also to the character daywalker ) .
but i 'll try to put all the things i liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything i did n't like in another paragraph , so it will be easier to read !
let 's start with the good things !
the quote `` strong bloody violence '' ( which is used by rating boards , to describe the content of a movie , does fit here very well .
this is not a movie for kids !
or for the faint of hearted !
it has blade as a central character ( wesley snipes is phenomenal ) and a crazy enough story thread to hold/justify the action scenes !
the original idea is also very engaging and intelligent .
the action scenes are great here too.ok over to the things i did n't like .
the overall story is too thin .
it 's enough as i 've written above to hold the action scenes together , but there could be more .
and a character like blade deserves more ( imo ) .
the drama therefor is n't the best ... also it 's use of clich√©s does n't help .
some characters are underwritten ... that 's that !
