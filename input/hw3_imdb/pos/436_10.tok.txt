i just viewed jean renoir 's wonderful film , french can can .
it is a visual delight and a great entertainment .
the recently produced moulin rouge pales by comparison .
i did n't quite get all of the praise that the recent movie received .
now i 'm convinced more than ever , that my appraisal was correct after seeing a master film maker like jean renoir 's version of the same story .
he succeeded in getting great performances out of his entire cast , and the great french actor , jean gabin was in rare form .
the dance sequence near the end was one of the most exciting one i 'd ever seen .
it was long , but i did n't want it to end .
this film deserves to receive more recognition than it 's got .
