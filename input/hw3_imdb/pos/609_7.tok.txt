a look at three geishas who are way past their prime .
now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present .
kin ( played by floating weeds ' haruko sugimura ) has sworn off men and has made a good living as a moneylender ; everyone on the block owes her .
the other two , nobu and tamae , wish they could land husbands , but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will .
meanwhile , their children - one has a son and one a daughter - are both about to get married ( not to each other ) .
tamae is irked at how much prettier her daughter has become than her , and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry the man .
nobu 's concerns about her son are more legitimate in nature , but they are also ( understandably ) self-serving .
after her son leaves , she 'll be alone .
a bit into the film , two of kin 's former clients come looking for her , one a man so obsessed with her that he tried to get her to commit double suicide with him , the other one of her handsomest clients .
unfortunately , he comes for her money , not her love .
the way i 've described the film makes it sound unrelentingly depressing , but it 's really not .
sad , but not fatally so .
it 's more bittersweet .
unfortunately , i only marginally liked late chrysanthemums .
the story seems better when i look back on it , but it is very slow and dull .
i actually nodded off twice during the film , and i was n't at all tired before i started it .
this is the kind of film that i can appreciate more than like ; it reminds me very much of my reaction to a couple of ozu 's more famous films .
7/10 .
