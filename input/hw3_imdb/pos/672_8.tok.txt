a terrific b-feature .
a virtual two-hander and set over the course of a day , ( you can see it 's stage origins and even how it must have worked as a radio play ) , and although only 77 minutes long , played out in sequences akin to something like real time .
robert ryan is the psychopath who keeps ida lupino trapped in her own home .
both are superb , especially the under-rated lupino whose initial independence and self-control soon crumble before ryan 's unhinged intruder .
today , of course , it would be all guts and gore but the restraint shown by director harry horner , ( much better known as an art director ) , only adds to the suspense which at times is worthy of hitchcock .
