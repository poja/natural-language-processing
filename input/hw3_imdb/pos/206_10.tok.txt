the plot of this movie is set against the most terrible war in history of mankind : the violent clash between adolf hitler 's germany and soviet russia , from 1941-'45.with the western areas of their country thoroughly devastated , and 20 to 30 million russian people killed , the vibes of this conflict can be felt in russia up to the present day .
let alone back in 1957 , when memories were still very fresh and painful.this very black setting strongly contrasts with the fine and coherent style of 'letjat zhuravli 's ' beautiful shots .
its simple story deals with human behaviour in times of war : bravery , love , patriotism , weakness , cowardice and corruption .
all beautifully tied together by a toy-squirrel.add to this the truly magnificent acting , and it 's easy to understand why this movie is so famous .
really , one of the very best ever made .
