a wonderful film ahead of its time , i think so , in the eighty 's it was all about winning , greed is good ?
remember that one ?
i have seen this film more that 20 times , to me this is a real desert island film , i keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that i just love , jessica tandy , and hume cronin , are simply wonderful , also beverly d'angelo , beau bridges come in at a close second , do n't get me wrong there are many more great performance 's in this film , and it is also the way it is written that made it for me , and i hope you , a film that you will want to see over and over , i think tv shows like `` northen exposure '' , and now `` earl '' owe a lot to this film .
but remember it is not a tom cruise film .
