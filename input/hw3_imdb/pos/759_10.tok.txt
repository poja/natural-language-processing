i had to get this movie , since it did n't come to where i live .
i waited patiently and it was worth the wait .
i totally fell in love with this movie .
the chemistry between walters and grint you could see , since they also worked together on the harry potter movies.the woman who plays his overbearing , righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a hypocrite she is , i think she did a great job playing the role .
i only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it .
lol , but of course we just have to use our imagination on how it went down .
( snickers ) i totally thought the movie was worth the wait and if you want a good movie to watch .
rent this movie .
i do have to say that rupert really did a great job and it 's nice to see that he 's doing movies outside of harry potter , even though i totally love him as ron weasley .
the whole cast did a great job and i hope rupert continues to act outside of harry potter to broaden his skill !
