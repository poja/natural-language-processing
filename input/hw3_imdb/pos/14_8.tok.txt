i attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin costner and ashton kutcher ; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films .
while the underlying `` general '' storyline is somewhat familiar , this film was excellent .
both costner and kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other .
the human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both ; the scene when costner confronts kutcher with the personal reasons why kutcher joined the coast guard rescue elite was the film 's most unforgettable emotional moment .
the `` specific '' storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite coast guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibility ... to save lives at sea .
the special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and `` wowing '' ... i have n't seen such angry seas since `` the perfect storm '' .
co-star clancy brown ( hbo 's `` carnivale '' - great to see him again ) played the captain of the coast guard 's kodiak , alaska base in a strong , convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins .
the film wonderfully , and finally , gives long overdue exposure and respect to the coast guard ; it had the audience applauding at the end .
