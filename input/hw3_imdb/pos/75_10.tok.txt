this often maligned movie is a must for fans of blake edwards , julie andrews , henry mancini , or hollywood musicals .
other writers have commented on the shifts in tone , the confusion of plot , etc.
, but the film has many things to recommend it .
the score is one of henry mancini 's best ( and he has written many wonderful ones ) , several songs are sung to perfection by andrews , julie 's performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes , ( she is at her absolutely loveliest here ) , the on-location shots are breath-taking , and there are some funny inspector clouseau-type sight gags to boot .
rock hudson basically phoned in his performance , but he is passably good .
a real curiosity item in that it was the last major film julie did for about 10 years and , in many ways , is a precursor to victor/victoria .
it is lovely to look at and listen to .
when will it be available on dvd ?
?
?
when it is , i for one would like both versions -- the longer and shorter , director 's cut .
since it was lampooned in s.o.b.
, they would make a great two-pack !
