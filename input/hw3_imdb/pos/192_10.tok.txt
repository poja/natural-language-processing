mikhail kalatozov 's the cranes are flying is a superb film .
winner of the golden palm at cannes film festival , it has an excellent cinematography and performance by tatyana samojlova , the only russian actor ever to win an award in cannes for a performance .
she plays veronika , a teenager in love with her boyfriend , happy and without preoccupations , with plans of getting married .
her life will get upside down when world war ii strikes and her boyfriend volunteers to the army .
the film depicts the effect of war on a teenager love and on the people that stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight , waiting for a letter or other information .
it is a portrayal of lost innocence .
samojlova does a magnificent job , and her character transformation will break your heart .
the camera movement is fast with a lot of close-ups , it is a dancing camera .
the first scene in the stairs is fantastic , but it is n't the only one , there is later a scene when veronika attempts committing suicide , and another , in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in movie history , the bombing of veronika 's house when she runs the stairs in the middle of fire , to find her apartment completely destroyed .
simply great !
10 out of 10 .
