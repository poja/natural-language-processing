`` big fat liar '' comes as a welcome -- shallow , but welcome -- breath of fresh air after one too many films featuring bathrooms , bodily fluids , pets on acid , gaseous jokes and crotch gags .
after all , `` see spot run , '' `` max keeble 's big move '' and `` snow dogs '' had signaled the degenerative spiral of kiddie movie-making .
worse is the realization that the young audience would later be satiated by the smuttier offerings of `` not another teen movie '' and `` slackers . ''
written by nickelodeon producers dan schneider and brian robbins ( who coincidentally co-starred on the '80s sitcom `` head of the class '' ) , the film stars frankie muniz as jason , who 's always ready with a good lie to get out of scrapes .
( where 's the english paper ?
dad choked on a swedish meatball . )
his teacher ( sandra oh ) issues an ultimatum : turn in the paper by the end of the day or take summer school .
jason whips out a story called `` big fat liar '' and is struck en route to school by a limousine carrying insensitive hollywood producer marty wolf ( paul giamatti ) .
wolf gives him a ride , but jason leaves his paper behind .
no one will hear the truth this time , and dad tells him he 's lost his trust.months later , jason and best friend kaylee ( amanda bynes ) see a movie preview for `` big fat liar , '' and head off to los angeles to wreak havoc on wolf 's life -- all to get a confession that he stole jason 's paper to make the film .
they even gain the sympathy of some of wolf 's abused employees , including his assistant ( amanda detmer ) , former chauffeur ( donald faison ) , movie star ( jaleel `` urkel '' white , playing himself ) and stunt coordinator ( a much-aged lee majors ) .because `` big fat liar '' is without the edge that his sitcom `` malcolm in the middle '' is known for , muniz is easy to root for but does n't have much to work with .
likewise for bynes , who headlines her own tracey ullman-like sketch show on nickelodeon .
all the hamminess is given to giamatti , whose eyes bulge and cheeks wiggle with every sneering insult.the film gets snaps just by attempting the high road , and should be enjoyed by its target audience ( especially since most of the high jinks occur on the universal studios lot ) .
but here 's one head-scratcher : the message is that it pays to tell the truth .
but did n't we just see jason getting to his payback by telling white lies throughout the film ?
well , at least there 's no poop .
