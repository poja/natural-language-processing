like steven seagal i also am a big van damme fan and have followed most of his movies since the start of his acting career.in this flick van damme assumes the role of jack robideaux whom is a cop that just moved to new mexico from new orleans to work as part of the border patrol .
haunted by memories of his past , it is up to jack to put an end to a group of ex-navy seals from smuggling illegal drugs into the u.s. that killed his daughter.overall i found this film to be very good , van damme is in very good shape for 48 years old and can really move .
the action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws a couple of plot twists in to keep you guessing .
unfortunately van damme does not have the same intensity as he did say 10 years ago , regardless the shepherd : border control is the 3rd straight solid film that van damme has made possibly opening the door for a larger project.i definitely recommend this movie to a van damme fan or fan of action movies in general ; the shepherd : border control is a great movie , not as good as until death but better than the hard corps .
be sure to give this one a try , you will not be disappointed .
