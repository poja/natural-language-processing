a fantastic film featuring great aussie talent .
director mark lamprell dealt with the potentially sob-inducing subject matter in a way which was humorous and refreshing .
definitely the highlight of the 2000 brisbane international film festival .
australian film veteran , sam neill was , as always , fabulous in the role of frank 's uni professor and new talent matt newton gave a performance which will have people saying , `` you know , bert newton , matt 's dad ! ''
get out and see this movie !
