stmd !
is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films i 've seen in quite some time .
director jeff smith ( who also served as co-writer , cinematographer and editor ) definitely shows his love of under-appreciated 80 's horror films with this movie !
anyone who loves the cheesiness , preposterous situations , wacky and stereotypical characters of 80 's horror movies will definitely love this very tongue-in-cheek homage to the past.stmd !
definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some .
it has all the `` excessive violence '' and `` gratuitous nudity '' that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80 's horror movies we all love .
i had a blast watching stmd !
from the 80 's outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone i just could n't get enough !
