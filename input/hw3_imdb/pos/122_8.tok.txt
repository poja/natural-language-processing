overall , a well done movie .
there were the parts that made me wince , and there were the parts that i threw my hands up at , but i came away with something more than i gone in with.i think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition .
without spoiling it , let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in ramayana , is way beyond what this movie stands for .
the ramayana is an epic .
not a 200 page book that puts down women in india .
the movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive indian family .
while the basic tenets of the `` unwritten laws of the family tradition '' seem to be that of conservative india , let me assure my reader that i ( having lived in delhi for 12 years ) found entire parts that just did not ring those bells .
i mean some things and some actions are very true , but some other stuff is just way off the mark .
especially today.delhi is complicated .
india is complicated .
the director tries to simplify both .
and fails pretty miserably at that.why in english ?
can you imagine a movie about american indians in english .
or the french speaking in english .
seriously jarring .
even the servant spoke in fluent accented english ( albeit with a hint of colloquialisms in the language for `` believability '' ) .but the chemistry between the leads is palpable .
if you like it hot , this is a movie for you .
i think that is the biggest saving grace - the development of a true real life love story.if this film was about radha and sita , then it would have got full marks from me .
and in being about them , it could have made a subtle statement .
but this movie goes out there to say this is what india is , and this is what indian society is like .
and in that respect it succeeds as much as it fails .
just take everything you see with a pinch of salt .
the dark secrets of india are not being revealed .
just two girls are falling in love .
just like it happens everywhere else .
