spoiler alert !
do n't read on unless you 're prepared for some spoilers.i think this film had a lot beneath its shell .
besides the apparent connections with `` oldboy '' ( and park-wook 's other films ) , an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me , and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric , physical action.the main actor , kang-ho song , is terrific in the r√¥le of the priest sang-hyeon - coincidentally , `` sang '' means `` blood '' in some languages - who truly loved tae-ju , played by ok-bin kim .
their relationship reminds me a lot of that between martin sheen and sissy spacek in `` badlands '' , where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger.their relationship is one thing , but the girl 's mother is entirely different .
while moving , she is stiff , one-dimensional and taut , but paralysed , she says all through not moving , or through the wink of an eye.park-wook has really , really mastered his cinematography in this film , and owes a lot to stanley kubrick ; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film , some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.the music is quite stock , using mostly strings to accompany the main thespian 's monoreaction ; it 's a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is .
while he does very little and loses at that , he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot .
while his love-interest says and does a lot , her actions display very little thought behind it .
in my humble opinion.all in all , a very disturbing film that is not made for action , which is n't even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days ; it 's magnificent , and repellant at the same time .
