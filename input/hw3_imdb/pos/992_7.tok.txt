this is primarily about love in wwii , yet we must remember that it 's also a biopic for dylan thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life.the movie 's timing is just great .
it really captures what i think would have been the spirit during those times ; smiling and hoping you 're not going to get bombed .
while it may prove boring to some , the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it.at one point , my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax .
it really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors .
cillian murphy is on fine form here , as is matthew rhys .
both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch .
the relationship formed between sienna miller and keira knightley 's characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank ( and watch out for a cameo by suggs of 'madness ' ) .
despite all of this , it 's a rather slow movie .
coupled with the fact it 's just shy of two hours , it 's quite a slog to get to the conclusion.overall , it 's a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of well-known british names behind the scenes .
but it really does drone on for too much at times .
still , a worthwhile watch .
