i really like traci lords .
she may not be the greatest actress in the world but she 's rather good in this .
she play the dowdy , conservative , reporter to a 't ' .
it 's a great little thriller which keeps you guessing for a good while .
jeff fahey is also good as traci 's boss .
i think given a decent break traci could be a top actress .
she 's certainly no worse than some of today 's leading ladies .
