i thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted .
its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoyment.rupert grint played the part marvelously , and has a general knack for the acting business .
the almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot , and was a character one could almost instantly loathe .
this reminded me , in a way , of the divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood .
not by means of actual content of the film , but the premises , and overall tone to the film itself .
`` driving lessons '' is a coming of age story , which many might find very easy to relate to due to the overpowering mother , the lack of freedom , and the discovery of oneself .
