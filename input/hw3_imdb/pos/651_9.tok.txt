i remember watching this movie over and over again when i was a kid .
i loved it .
whilst i have n't watched it recently , i am sure i would enjoy it just the same today .
its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh .
the situations with each one of the characters were so funny and imaginative !
i particularly liked the one with the girl traveling with her mother 's ashes ( who ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion ) , the robbers and the nuns .
this nice humour style is much missed these days .
also , this movie proved that actor paul keenan ( dynasty/days of our lives ) was off to a great start .
i recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it in their local video shop .
