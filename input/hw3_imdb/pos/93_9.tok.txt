a boy who adores maurice richard of the montreal canadiens receives , much to his horror , a toronto maple leafs sweater in the mail .
i recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey , but nearly everyone knew about maurice richard and the toronto/montreal rivalry .
highly entertaining , amusing , and accurate .
