i like `` hack . ''
think the `` lone ranger '' reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver , a decent but flawed guy , in philadelphia doing his best , while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past , and you 've got the synopsis .
david morse is nearly perfect as olshansky .
he helps people but instead of riding `` silver '' in the old west he drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary philly , without handing out silver bullets .
the supporting cast is first class and well above average .
at times , the witty dialog almost reaches the level of that 70s classic series , `` the rockford files . ''
this show deserves a return , hopefully in a better time slot than 9pm friday ( eastern ) .
