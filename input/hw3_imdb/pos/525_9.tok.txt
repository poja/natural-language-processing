i did n't know what to expect from this hugely popular ( and hilarious ) swedish comedy & satire team , as they released their first feature film .
more broad satire ?
well , we do get four contemporary , exceptionally memorable tales of family pains , generation gaps and fatherhood , in particular .
but it 's drama , thankfully , and what drama !
epic in its scope , as each episode is from carefully picked , geographically different parts of sweden .
but each story could seriously carry a whole movie , if expanded separately.it 's dark , twisted , harrowing , yet massively entertaining and breathtakingly executed .
script , acting and cinematography are absolute world class , as three hours seem to get by in a blink !
it 's four shades of mastery , and easily one of the best films in the nations ' cinema history .
it 's sweden 's answer to `` short cuts '' or `` magnolia '' , if you like , and instantly on par with those !
