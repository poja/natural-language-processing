anywhere but here is not exactly anything new , but the excellent performances by both of the main actresses made it worth watching .
sarandon and portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural wisconsin to sunny beverly hills , california , in search of a better life .
the main conflict comes from the fact that natalie would much rather have stayed in wisconsin with all of her friends and family , and she felt that she was forced to go to california with her overbearing mother .
( spoilers ) while it 's true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable , susan sarandon and especially natalie portman give performances that are so good that they almost make the material seem new .
anywhere but here does n't cover any new ground , but it does have the rare quality of being able to take overused subject matter and make it fairly interesting again .
also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years , seen on natalie portman 's face when her mother drops her off on the side of the road and she watches the car fade into the distance .
particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot about natalie 's mother pressing her to become an actress , as well as a very convincing performance from shawn hatosy as one of natalie 's very close cousins from back home .
his death is a tragic clich√© almost always seen in movies like this one , but the rest of the film makes up for numerous weaknesses like this .
not great , but anywhere but here is definitely worth a look .
