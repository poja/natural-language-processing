this film works on a lot of different levels .
it 's a profile of one very cool couple , a social commentary on aging and nursing homes , a love story , a musical .
i 've seen uncle frank a few times , and every time i watch it i 'm not sure who to go call first -- my parents , my wife , a friend i 've lost touch with .
.
but it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your life -- and want to reaffirm the ones that continue .
expect a lot of laughs , and probably some tears if any of the vibrant characters here strike a chord .
i 'm pretty sure they will .
