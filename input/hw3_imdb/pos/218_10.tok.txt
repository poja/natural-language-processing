i first remember bumping into this zaniness from the zucker brothers and jim abrahams , back in the early days at comedy central .
back in those days ( the 90 's ) their programming consisted of benny hill reruns and the original mst3k , complete with bearded host.capt .
frank drebin ( played by the stone-faced , dead-pan filibuster , leslie nielson ) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists ( think dragnet meets starsky & hutch the show ) , boiled in a flask full of well-known police television show plots and scenarios .
this is distilled , 3 times to produce the most pure policeman every made .
forget about simon pegg in hot fuzz ( for now .
save it for later ) .
frank drebin is clueless at most times , a terrible driver , a terrible shot , macho yet sensitive and vulnerable .
he is a master of the police investigative methodology ( a.k.a - ask johnny the leathery old shoe-shine boy ) .
this does not make him a bad cop .
cops get lucky also .
capt drebin ( notice he 's a captain here ) has perfected it .
along with his partner , nordberg , and the rest of force , perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episodes.the show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote-ables .
most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly .
the magic never came from the sight gags , however .
at its core was a nonsensical and straight-faced conversation and activities in the foreground , with crazy things occurring in the background .
the movies can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best gags from this series .
think of monty python 's and now for something completely different ... ..if you liked airplane 1 & 2 , naked gun 1,2,3 , or top secret , then you will definitely enjoy this .
i always liked the series better than the movies , even though i saw the movies first .
why ?
