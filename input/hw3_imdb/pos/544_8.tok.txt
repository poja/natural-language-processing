regarded as another one of the recent over-the-top drama 's brought upon us by hollywood , this movie excels where others have totally failed ( especially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of natalie portman ) , this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both susan and natalie share .
they seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family .
they go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities .
i feel that these two actress ' talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar ( full of cliche 's ) and really saved the suffering plot .
i would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such over-the-top drama 's .
