you think the police are always right.you believe that `` eye-witnesses '' are always right.you believe the prosecutors will not take a case to court if lazy police have failed to perform 98 % of a basic investigation.you believe a u.s. city might have a `` few bad apples '' in law enforcement , but that the `` good cops '' will quickly nip those who systematically engage in evil-for-evil 's sake in the bud.you believe that the possibility of an ex-football lineman being instated as a detective solely because his dad is the county sheriff , and being allowed to beat `` confessions '' out of randomly-selected teenagers with absolutely no fear of negative consequences to himself could happen in the america of the 1930s , but not today.you believe a judge will not send a case to the jury if anyone with a brain in their head can see the defendant is a totally random passer-by nabbed by the police because it was hot , and they did not feel like working that day.you believe that all the innocent people imprisoned six months here or 20 years there are `` exceptions to the rule , '' and an injustice like this could never involve your family member , someone in the middle class , or someone like you.you think that you are aware of every terrible , indisputable , 100 % proved outrage of the last 10 years in america -- yet you have n't seen this film .
