i ca n't see how a film of this quality only gets an average of 5.7 from imdb voters .
it 's a classic australian production that resembles recent efforts such as love and other catastrophes , the sugar factory , occasional coarse language , russian doll , sample people , the secret life of us , la spagnola , strange planet , fresh air , dust off the wings , doing time for patsy cline , etc ... , as a 19-year-old uni student ( newton , in perhaps his best role yet , on par with changi at least ) with a bored , over-religious mother gets the shock of his life when she decides to enrol in the same course as him - and before you go thinking another goofy movie , it 's not , there 's some real substance here .
sure , it 's a simplistic view of life in general and arts students in particular ( but then they are rather simplistic under all that philosophical mumbo-jumbo are n't they ? )
, and maybe the study of sinead cusack 's character is a little muddled at times , but the film is bright , funny , and has some important messages .
the principle cast is terrific : cusack and newton are wonderful , and rose byrne ( see her also in the goddess of 1967 ) is so underrated it 's not funny .
she 's a beautiful , fresh , confident actor who deserves every accolade she receives .
i gave my mother frank 8/10 .
