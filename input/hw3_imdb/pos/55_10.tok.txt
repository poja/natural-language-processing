no blood , no sex ( though it oozes passion ) , no special effects , but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when you 're not really looking and grabs your attention .
great acting , great sets , great music , beautiful storyline .
if only there were a lot more movies made like this one !
the sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there.the acting appears like real life , and elevates us to the level of awareness of `` nanny '' , to whom no-one is a lost cause , least of all the inhabitants of her own `` halfway '' house .
best of all it 's a true story of misfits learning to `` fit in '' .
i was somewhat jealous of the good times that everyone appeared to be having in the movie !
could we all spend some time in nanny 's house ?
