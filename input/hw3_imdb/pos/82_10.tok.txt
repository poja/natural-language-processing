when the circus comes to town and places the lion 's cage directly over bugs bunny 's home , bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid .
despite the title `` acrobatty bunny '' , it 's only at the end when bugs and the lion perform acrobatics .
but even leading up to that , it 's quite funny what bugs does to escape getting eaten ; somehow , he always manages to use the other character 's weakness against him , and then pull any convenient object out of thin air !
bugs later ended up in the circus in `` big top bunny '' .
i liked this one better , as the latter got drug down a little bit by giving the antagonist an eastern european accent ( i know that it was during the cold war , but still ) .
i recommend this one.and with the end , we can affirm that it 'll never be aloha oe for this cartoon .
