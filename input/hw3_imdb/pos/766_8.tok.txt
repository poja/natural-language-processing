i really only watched this movie because it had rupert grint in it ( who i knew as ron from the harry potter movies ) .
i had never really appreciated rupert as an actor until this movie .
i loved the entire film .
rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious , quirky movie .
i think the movie could have been fine without the sex , but it worked somehow .
i ca n't wait to see more of rupert 's films in the future .
julie walters also did an amazing job .
in the harry potter movies , she has a very small role , so i did n't quite know what to expect from her either .
but she was wonderful as dame evie .
the part where she swallows the key was absolutely hilarious .
overall , an amazing movie .
