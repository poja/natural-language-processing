in today 's world of advertising and teenage horror and sensationalism it is very rare that one gets to see a movie and no nothing about it .
movies like psycho and blair witch , while being great in suspense ( both with great build ups ) are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them .
with mute witness , a rare treat , i stumbled upon this film and watched it , scared witless , in the middle of the night .
i was scared by the menacing russian ambience , the 'snuff ' theme and the claustrophobic plight of the mute and the fact that the ( amusing , which always leads to likeable ) characters could meet the end at any second .
since this is a low budget and rare film we watch it without any expectations .
it also has fay ripley in a rare movie role , watch and prepare to be excited , scared and thrilled in totally unexpected ways .
