an interesting and involved film about a `` lifer '' just trying to live out his days peacefully .
elements of the main character appear in michael mann 's later films , like thief ( 1981 ) , heat ( 1995 ) , and so on .
you can see this one at the ucla instructional media laboratory -- one of the only places in the country that has copies readily available to the public .
it 's a great one !
