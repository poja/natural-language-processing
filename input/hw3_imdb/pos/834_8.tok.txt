well it is a good movie .
however , you have to admit that van dame 's movies have n't been so great lately .
on the other hand if you are a hardcore van dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes .
also what i really liked is the music beautiful music .
am sure this will kill time if you are action fan .
as for isaac florentine the director of undisputed 2 , i do n't think he did a good job as he did with undisputed.i cant wait when one day van dame 's movies hit the cinemas before the dvd .
maybe , one day : ) .in the end it worth the watch if you got no other action movies to watch , this could make your hour and half fun .
