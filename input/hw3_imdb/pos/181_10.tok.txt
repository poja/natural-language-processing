while boris ( aleksey batalov ) is off to fight in war against the germans for his mother russia , his beloved veronika ( tatyana samojlova ) marries his conniving cousin mark ( aleksandr shvorin ) in a moment of weakness shortly after her parents were killed in an air raid over moscow .
through various trials and betrayals , veronika will await word or letter from boris no matter how long it takes , holding hope that he will return to her.powerful piece of film-making boasts simply incredible photographic work by cinematographer sergei urusevsky .
some of the many magnificently framed , moving shots include the scene where the camera follows veronika through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other as she rushes through the mob of bodies to say goodbye to boris..and does n't quite reach him even as we watch boris looking impatiently into the swarm without luck .
the sequence after the air raid where veronika walks up the standing stairs circulating up the destroyed building she once called home and the scene where mark makes his lustful move on veronika as another air raid continues just outside the building as wind rustles the curtains and flashes of light emanate inside are just two of many examples where sergei urusevsky shows his genius at framing images that will last forever on film .
but , without the power and tragedy of the story regarding how war can forever shape the destiny of a couple who dearly , deeply love each other , this film could n't hold up with the beauty of the visual alone .
together , however , we 're left with an amazing film..simply a haunting masterpiece from the soviet union after stalin breathed his last breath .
i feel honored just have beheld such a great film .
