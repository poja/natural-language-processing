i must say : out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out .
it was n't as epic as musa-the warriors and did n't develop the characters as well , but it had many nice ideas .
simple story : a elite soldier thought dead , returns after years to end the reign of the japanese in korea in medieval days .
his counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him .
the fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch .
the motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end .
you might need to watch it again to get all the connections right .
and me personally ... i loved the end .
i could watch it over and over again .
maybe a little pathetic , but a real freedom fighter story ... .
people can be killed , but not the ideas they stand for ... .
