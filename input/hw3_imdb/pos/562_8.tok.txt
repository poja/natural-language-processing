anyone that is looking for an episode of `` law and order '' or `` csi '' would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this case.a murder took place , and all the police did was to grab a 15-year-old boy off the street and take him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and say is this the guy who did it ?
sure , the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty .
never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently .
he must have shrunk , reversed his age by 5-10 years and changed clothes.the police made absolutely no effort - and they admitted it !
the did no forensics on any of the evidence , they questioned no other witnesses , and they beat a confession out of a 15-year-old.the saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred right down the road in jacksonville , florida .
let everyone now start talking about `` southern justice . ''
