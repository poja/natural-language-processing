one of the best , lackawanna bluesgreat movie , great cast , great music , this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutes , i will w3atch this one many times .
this is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature .
the cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role .
you get the sense that you 're really there taking all this in .
a great deal of care was given in the sets , costumes and music of the period .
the relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on , but the steady performance of ms. merkerson is so powerful that the movie ends before we 've had our fill of the wonderful misfits .
to single out anyone other than `` nanny '' is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors including : jeffery wright , jimmy smits , terrence howard and delroy lindo .
but it is marcus franklin , macy gray and ms. merkerson that makes this a wonderful experience.the movie moves rapidly and is short by todays standards , but it is without question one of the best movies you 're going to see this year .
if you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally , tug at your heart , lift you joyfully and have you tapping your feet at the same time , then this is the movie for you .
i 've shown it to several friends and they all want my copy , that says it all , the movie is that good .
check it out for yourself.danceability-1 , amsterdam holland
