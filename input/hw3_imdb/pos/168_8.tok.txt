this agreeably perverse and oddball early 80 's teen body count flick may never reach the astonishingly bent pinnacle of the deeply unsettling and criminally underrated murderous moppets movie `` devil times five , '' but it 's still an above average killer kid opus nonetheless.the slim , but serviceable plot centers on a trio of misfit tykes -- two bratty boys and one creepily twinkle-eyed , albeit angelic-looking little girl -- who are all born during a solar eclipse on june 9th , 1970. when the strange antisocial trio , who stick together in a tightly self-contained and exclusive circle , reach ten years of age they suddenly go homicidally bonkers and declare open season on the hapless , unsuspecting local yokels of the heretofore sleepy and peaceful california suburb of meadowvale .
writer/director ed hunt , the usually incompetent unsung hack responsible for such wonderfully wretched clunkers as the delightfully dopey `` starship invasions , '' the uproariously inane jesus christ vigilante parable ( ! )
`` alien warrior , '' and the stunningly silly `` the brain , '' does a pretty solid and capable job here : the kill scenes are abundant and reasonably brutal ( the arrow-through-the-eye gag is especially nasty ) , there 's a sizable smattering of gratuitous nudity and soft-core sex , a goodly amount of tension is neatly created and maintained , some nice dollops of dark humor punctuate the arrestingly warped mayhem , and the surprise grim ending manages to be truly jolting.moreover , the top-drawer cast further elevates the proceedings to the perfectly watchable and absorbing : jose ferror as a small-town doctor , future `` jake and the fatman '' tv series star joe penny as an amateur astrologer , `` the prey '' 's lori lethin as the plucky babysitter heroine , susan strasberg as a bitchy school teacher , `` american ninja '' 's michael dudikoff as a chowderhead jock , and cyril o'reilly ( the lonely misanthrope vampire in the hauntingly melancholy `` dance of the damned '' ) as a libidinous teen dude who gets bagged while doing just what you think with some naked hot chick in back of a parked van .
billy jacoby ( who went on to star in such late 80 's direct-to-video dross as `` dr. alien '' and `` demonwarp '' ) , andy freeman , and especially the eerily adorable elizabeth hoy are genuinely creepy and convincing as the terrible troika of chillingly evil and amoral rugrats .
and , yes , that 's none other than julie brown , the brassy comedienne who scored a surprise top 40 hit with the hilarious novelty tune `` the homecoming queen 's got ta gun , '' as the lovely , vacuous , full-breasted redhead bimbo who does a great lengthy , totally extraneous , yet still sizzling and much-appreciated nude striptease while dancing in her bedroom to a cheesy blaring rock song !
all in all , this baby sizes up as a sturdy and satisfying slasher item .
