the submarine used was not varangian !
'it ' was in fact two boats , p614 and p615 , both built for turkey by vickers armstorng at barrow-in-furness but kept hold of by the royal navy for the duration of the war .
p615 was sunk but p614 was eventually delivered in 1945. the confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up p61 ( as i did ) and found varangian !
when in fact , the last digit of both p614 and p615 was in fact just painted out ... .there are some extremely realistic moments in the film .
these turkish boats were very similar to the s-class .
as no s-class submarines survive , the shots of them ( as p61 ) and of the depot ship `` forth '' form part of an interesting record now , as well as an excellent film .
