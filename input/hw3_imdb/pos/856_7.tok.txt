stephanie meyer is going to be so ticked !
now , her book `` breaking dawn '' will not be first with that title .
sorry , twilight fans.kelly overton ( the ring two ) is medical student , eve , who is assigned to interview psychotic don ( james haven - angelina jolie 's brother ) .
i suspected the twist , and when she found out they both grew up in the same town , i was sure of it.she kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that i felt there was a shared delusion going on .
at times , she even acted like she had ptsd .
i really thought she was losing it.well , she was n't losing it , and when the end came , i was floored .
my whole suspicion turned out to be wrong .
the twist was even more amazing than i believed.overton was fantastic and the story is so much better than something stephanie meyer would come up with .
a must see .
