i would assume that this film would get rave reviews in canada -- particularly in quebec .
that 's because the canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the montreal canadians were like gods in canada for decades .
as an american , the closest thing we have to them are the new york yankees .
if you are a fan , then they are the greatest and winningest team in history .
if you are not a fan , then they are satan 's team !
!
well , at least that 's how it was as i grew up in washington , dc in regard to the dallas cowboys .
so i am pretty sure when this film was shown up north that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction -- their national sport and the closest thing they have to a national team in the nhl.now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around ottawa and rooting for the canadians and maurice `` the rocket '' richard .
however , when his mother accidentally buys him a toronto maple leafs jersey and forces him to wear it , i knew right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy .
this ability to connect to the character -- even though he lives in a far off land is what made this a very special short film .
the way the other kids treated him and his conversation with god at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film .
very clever and memorable .
