i 've felt that rupert grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him .
so even though i had never heard of this film before , when it appeared in my cable tv listings , i immediately switched to that channel .
i am so happy that i did !
i 've read from other reviewers that they do n't generally like coming of age stories ; i on the other hand quite do .
i am one of those who is always coming of age ; i have been since i was 12 , i 'm 52 now , and i will probably continue until i 'm 92. coming of age is nothing more than suddenly realizing the possibilities that another day brings .
the suddenness of the realization , the magnitude of it , sometimes throws us into disarray .
if we try to shelter our delicate selves from that , then yes , i can see how the coming of age can end .
but if we simply dust ourselves off , and settle into the new direction we 've discovered , then we 're all of a sudden on a new path , and we 're just as alive as we were yesterday , only stronger , brighter , and i daresay , more interesting .
so that 's what this movie was about .
this was a coming of age story all the way round ; young ben , his father , father robert , and certainly dame evie ... all went through a marvelous transformation .
in fact , so too did mr. fincham , did n't he ?
!
all did , i suspect , except in fact the mother , in spite of her enormous opportunity so to do , provided by the events of the end of the film .
one is left with the feeling that she will continue on exactly the same path she 's been on , only with perhaps a different supporting cast.so an excellent film , that could not possibly have been made in america , which is utterly depressing to think about , but thank god we have a steady supply of films made elsewhere that we occasionally get to see .
i really heartily recommend this film , so long as you do n't mind cringing through those parts of it that are all too familiar to us all , and grinning through all the rest of it .
