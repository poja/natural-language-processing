though i strongly feel that sitr is the best gene kelly movie , but this a pretty good one .
i liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how gene got the girl .
my favorite part though without a doubt is gene 's dance with his alter ego .
i love watching two gene kelly 's for the price of one .
it shows what talent mr. kelly really was .
it is a movie that i think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time .
so you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today !
i 'm sure that everyone out there has a gene kelly friend that has this movie in their collection .
so go over to their house and pop some popcorn and enjoy !
