for a brief moment .
the opening scene with traci lords and thetechno bar is incredible .
i 'd probably follow her to my ultimate death too !
best vampire movie of all time but with a twist .
the fight scenes are awesome .
wesley snipes displays an athleticism you dont get to see every day .
and stephen dorff is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruit moving himself up the hierarchy by any means necessary .
great flick 9/10 .
where 's blade ii ?
