although i 'm not crazy about musicals , cover girl is a delight for classic movie buffs and especially for fans of rita hayworth and gene kelly .
the film may be dated by today 's standards and the story and songs may be nothing special , but the musical numbers are magnificently staged and there 's a terrific cast to go with the film .
plus , the film is a worthy introduction for fans of rita hayworth ... she 's simply breathtaking in glorious technicolor.despite jerome kern 's collaboration with the film , his music here is nowhere near as special or memorable as his songs in swing time ( 1936 ) , yet the songs serve the film well .
the dancing is nothing short of excellent , especially coming from gene kelly 's solo number and my favorite musical number , `` alter-ego dance . ''
the amusing phil silvers nearly steals the film as kelly 's partner .
otto kruger , eve arden , and edward brophy give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles .
and rita plays a sweet , charming girl here ; a role that 's a far cry from her femme fatale babes in films like blood and sand ( 1941 ) .all in all , this is a delightful film that 's worth watching even if you 're not big on musicals .
yet the film 's music could have been more memorable if only my favorite period songwriters , irving berlin or cole porter , wrote the songs for this film .
however , it 's the glorious technicolor cinematography and the imaginative dancing that are the real treats of the film 's production.while i was watching rita hayworth do her stuff , i do n't think i 've ever seen a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since i saw moira shearer in michael powell 's masterpiece , the red shoes ( 1948 ) .
just watch rita in cover girl and fall in love with her .
