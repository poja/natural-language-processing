the impossibly sexy rosie holotik plays charlotte beale , a new nurse at one of those movie-type asylums where the doctor in charge has his own , unorthodox ways of treating the inmates .
reluctantly bringing her on board is the officious dr. masters ( anne macadams , a.k.a .
annabelle weenick ) .
the inmates do n't take too kindly to charlotte , either.part mystery , part horror , this initial effort from b-movie director s.f .
brownrigg has an oppressive feel to it .
these colorful psychos , including a nymphomaniac with no self-esteem , a gentle giant who 's already had a lobotomy , and a supposed `` judge '' who speaks in legalese jargon , dominate the screen with their unnerving presence.it 's a picture that works fairly well , establishing the gritty , grim atmosphere right from the get go .
some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old fashioned exploitative quality.it builds in intensity as the imperiled heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity , offering one surreal encounter after another .
particularly effective is the poetry-quoting , dotty old mrs. callingham.for cheap 1970 's era cheese , it 's pretty effective , with a particularly nasty climax .
i had a pretty good time watching it.7/10
