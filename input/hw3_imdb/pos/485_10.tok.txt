cowboys and indians is an excellent film .
the writing , acting , directing could not have been better .
this was a story that begged to be told , and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so .
stories like this one are not pleasant ones , but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world .
it is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed .
a film that can do that is a rare a special thing .
andrew berzins is an excellent writer , and his talents and expertise in this field came shining through in this film .
thank you for telling this story !
