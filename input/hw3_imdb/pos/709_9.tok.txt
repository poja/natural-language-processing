a film that deserved theatrical release .
this made-for-television movie is a cinematic gem that exemplifies the technique of michael mann with stirring contemporary music tightly integrated to the visual images .
always with mr. mann , the amplification of impact by the music is almost as if there is an invisible academy-award-winning actor added to the ensemble of cast , writer , director and cinematographer.this film is definitely one of my all time favorites .
while nothing is perfect , this film comes very , very close.along with an excellent script , great direction and masterful acting by richard strauss , there is an all-star ensemble of character actors at their finest : roger mosely ; brian dennehy ; ed lauter ; geoffrey lewis ; richard moll ; miguel pinero ; william prince ; burton guilliam ; ji-tu cumbuka ; richard lawson and billy green bush .
you may not recognize the names , but you will recognize every face.if this comes on tv , sit down with popcorn , turn up the sound for an amazing soundtrack and score , and prepare to be riveted for the 97 minutes of the film .
i highly recommend recording it , since it is only available on vhs and dvd from holland and the dvd is region 2 encoded .
