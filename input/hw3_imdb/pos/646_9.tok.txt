love this little film , that reminds me somewhat of the original japanese gem , shall we dance ?
( not the overblown gere/jlo remake ... ) luckily i found it and taped it when it was showing on a starz promo weekend , because as far as i know , it 's not available on dvd .
i 'll watch just about anything with yancy butler ( anyone remember the short-lived tv series mann and machine ?
?
? )
in it , and she positively shines in this .
she does a dance routine to a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy hot !
!
loved all the other characters in it , especially the ones played by patrick stewart and leslie caron ( where 's she been all these years ? )
.
this is one of those films that i take out from time to time and always come away smiling after watching it .
recommended highly !
