another great musical from hollywoods golden age !
i liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are performers at a small nightclub that is far from broadway and all its glitter .
although not the big time they are very content with their lives and the small club where they perform .
gene kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of its dancers , rita hayworth who happens to garner some attention when she 's given an opportunity to be on a cover of a magazine .
trouble begins for gene kelly as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town .
phil silvers plays one of the three friends and does a good job .
of course there is the music and the dancing .
one dance performance by gene kelly stands out .
he is walking along the street at night alone and he see his reflection in a shop window .
his reflection soon starts dancing along with him in the streets , great cinematography .
do n't miss this one , great entertainment .
