this was my son 's review of the movie , which he wanted me to post.he wrote this , i swear.with malcolm in the middle 's frankie muniz , and nickelodeon 's amanda bynes , they get to go to show business .
they team up on the actor paul giamatti .
he stole jason shepherd 's essay on big fat liar , and makes it in to a movie .
jason ( frankie muniz ) and kaylee ( amanda bynes ) have to go to l.a. to get it back .
jason 's dad does not believe that he wrote that essay .
so every time they see each other jason asks wolf ( paul giamatti ) to give jason 's dad a call because he wants his essay back !

wolf does not make the movie but the president of the company makes it .
at the end the family and kaylee see the movie , made by wolf pictures and based on a real story written by jason shepherd .
