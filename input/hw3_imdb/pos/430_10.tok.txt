to keep it as simple as possible .
this is a very good show .
that is well written , and has a fantastic cast .
it 's not loaded with blood and guts .
and centers around a disgraced cop and his relationship with his ex-wife , his son , his former partner ( andre braugher ) , his childhood friend , now a priest ( george dzunzda ) , and lastly the person who happens to get into his hack in that episode .
are you likely to find something like this going on in your city no .
is this still a good story yes .
and it 's nice to see a man portrayed as good father in spite of his flaws .
watch more then one ( 2-3 ) and you 'll see why a lot of us are hooked on this show .
and thank you david morse for making this character so interesting .
another good job !
