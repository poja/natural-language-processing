big fat liar is the best movie ever !
it is funny , and cool .
jason shepherd ( frankie muniz ) proves that he was not lying and goes to los angeles to get his paper back from marty wolf ( paul giamatti ) .
along with friend kaylee ( amanda bynes ) , mess up his life since marty wo n't call jasons ' dad and say he wrote the paper !
yet it all turns out good and is a good movie to watch !
