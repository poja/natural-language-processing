this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema .
he intended to retire after this film , so in a way it is his artistic testament .
he died a couple of years after making the film , and though it is said that he intended to return to directing , destiny decided that this was indeed his last .
and what a film !
'rouge ' the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film .
set in geneva , one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge , and durenmatt immediately comes to mind .
but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere , in the lack of communication of the characters , in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life .
several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final , which only a great artist could have staged.little else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times .
yes , the film starts slowly , and the fans of the american style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers .
they deserve it .
the film gets quality as it advances , and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters .
cinema quality is very original , the image being a 'study in red ' , as the title shows .
acting is fabulous , with irene jacob and jean-louis trintignant - the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age .
a great film .
seeing it again probably adds , and i am happy to have it recorded on tape .
9/10 on my personal scale .
