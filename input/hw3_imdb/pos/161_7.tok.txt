i know little or nothing about astronomy , but nevertheless ; i was , at first , a little sceptical about the plot of this movie .
it follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion , and thus ( naturally ) become ruthless serial killers .
the plot does sound ridiculous at first , but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out saturn and , as you know , saturn is the emotion planet , it all falls into place ; makes complete sense and it 's then that you know you are n't simply watching another silly 80 's slasher with a pea brain plot .
thank god for that !
seriously , though , bloody birthday is based on a ridiculous premise , but it more than makes up for that with it 's originality .
having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema , but when given the choice between this and another dull friday the 13th clone - i know what i 'd choose.also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think it 's silly plot dug it into is the fact that it 's extremely entertaining .
many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore .
this film , however , keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids ( which harks back to creepy kid classics such as village of the damned ) , a constant stream of sick humour and a small , but impressive for the type of film , dose of suspense and tension .
one thing that i liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry .
there 's nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again ( cough halloween cough ) , but that 's not the case here as bloody birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows .
there was n't any room for a chainsaw , which is a huge shame , but i suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it .
