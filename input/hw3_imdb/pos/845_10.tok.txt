i 'm sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people .
the series started off very good and after the first season it was n't that good.people tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end .
this is not good to do , you should look at the total , not the end result .
it is sad that a lot of the `` usual '' characters died but , damn , we had a lot of nice new characters.please do not attach yourself to a few characters but attach yourself to the series , the plot .
please do understand that i did n't like it when boone died , when augur died but well ... it needs to be done .
can you imagine that everyone keeps living the whole series when they are in a lot of danger all the time ?
come on , face it , if they did n't die they would be invincible .
in this way you will always keep the tension , will he survive , will he die ?
i do realize that people attach their selves to characters , i do that too .
my favorite character was augur , the one who could get into every computer he wanted .
he was the one who was mysterious , he could do things with the computer no one else could do.i wish to make one statement to all the people who vote negative , does a series which started so good deserve to have such low rating ?
should we look at the final season instead of the total ?
should we not see how good the series was when it started ?
should we not see how much we enjoyed it ?
