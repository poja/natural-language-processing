one of best movies ever ... fire ... it is not much about sociological description of india today ... it is the mind blowing use of light that never stops , never becomes ... normal ... even when ... in this sense the movie is almost unique ... both leads are of very good quality ... the origin of das as a street performer are pretty obvious ... her performance is a superb `` cammeo '' ... but the use of the light ... i have look at it and looked at it , again and again ... still mind blowing after ages ... nothing torrid in the story ... rather `` pure '' way of facing the subject ... in a way it is sad that in the bizarre world we live today , a major art work is usually known as a gender film ... fire can stand face to face with dryer 's jeanne d ' arc or ichikawa 's biruma no tategoto or some of the major kurosawa movies , just to name `` some '' .
wish my input could help a little this movie to its deserved way to fame .
