'the dresser ' is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them .
written by ronald harwood ( himself a former dresser to the legendary donald wolfit ) , it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlights.as 'sir ' , the overbearing actor and main focus of the play , albert finney is a joy to watch - whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the 'blow , winds ... ' bit of 'king lear ' or chatting to his faithful stage manager , madge ( eileen atkins , good as ever ) about the old times .
as norman , his camp dresser , tom courtenay gives a fabulous performance , wiggling around at the beck and call of 'lear ' , collecting a bottle to go at the pub , or bitchily disparaging the former fool , mr davenport-scott ( often mentioned , but never seen ! )
.in an engaging support cast , there 's edward fox as oxenby ( a typical arrogant second lead ) , zena walker as her ladyship , lockwood west as the replacement fool , and many others.this film has great energy , bringing with it some of the greasepaint of its stage origins , it is true , but being so well-acted you do n't notice .
very well done indeed .
