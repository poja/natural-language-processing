irene jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of krzysztof kieslowski 's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in tying all three films together .
i am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories , let alone all three .
everything seems to fit together so precisely , all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed , and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts .
trois couleurs is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements .
simply brilliant !
