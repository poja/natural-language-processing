hello all !
i went to this movie without any expectation though i knew maniratnam would 've given an excellent film !
i was stunned !
!
the backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in sri lanka and the government .
the story is about how an young girl amudha who lives with her foster parents at chennai , india leaves to sri lanka in search of her real mother .
the high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse , the cinematography , editing and all other technical details .
full marks to the cast and crew .
i have to mention about the cinematography as it brings out the war in such a way that you feel yourself being there .
excellent work !
though the war sequences reminded me of saving private ryan , such a work was never attempted on indian screen .
overall the movie is great !
and hats off to mr.maniratnam.mani ratnam has once again proved that he is a director who can take indian cinema to great heights !
i would love to watch this film again and again .
an excellent film and a must see .
