everywhere i hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched ... .well maybe a do-good cab driver in philly is pushing it a little ( at least the cab drivers ive met ) , but that 's what makes the show great.the fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun .
its highly watchable and even though u know mike wins out in the end he never wins in life .
david morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role .
his supporting cast is great and i must say the location of the show is especially great !
all in all i watch this show not because im looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action , i watch this show because its got great acting , a good premise , and a great story-line every week .
it 's also a plus when i can pick out the landmarks he drives by , or know what intersection he 's at .
i love this show and i love philly !
!
give this show a shot !
