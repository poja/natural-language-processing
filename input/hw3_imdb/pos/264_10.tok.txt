rented this out from my local because it was the only new british film available this week .
never heard of the film-maker before or his other films ( thank you imdb ) .
about time some one made a good young british comedy that did n't star hugh grant or forty something 's .
the story is a morality tale but never preachy , throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast .
luke goss 's cameo was surprisingly very good , but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in 'blade ' .
loved the colour grading , especially in the night club sequences .
great music and a truly original voice at work here .
nine out of ten and well worth the rental charge .
