this is not your run-of-the mill police story where the characters were only secondary to the gun battles and car chases .
the episodes , so far , are more realistic and intelligent.if you are looking for something with a lot of butt-kicking rambo-style cop story , you will not find it here.i gave it a 9. i wish this series lives long .
morse is excellent !
