uncle frank is everyone 's uncle .
this documentary covered all aspects of aging in america , the lonliness , the humor , the irony .
uncle frank and aunt tillie were supremely generous in sharing their life experiences with the audience .
the director did an unbelieveable job of capturing the small and large pieces that made up their lives .
thanks to everyone who helped in making this film !
