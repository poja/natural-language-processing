this film is good in it 's genre and that genre is naturally action with a little/average budget .
looks like van damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director guiding him .
there is your basic bar brawl , alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting .
some basic drama , but nothing too deep .
isaac florentine directs an ok action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it .
but the person who steals the show is : scott adkins .
how come this guy is n't a massive arnold schwarzenegger caliber action star that i do n't know .
director isaac florentine has made a movie with scott adkins before called special forces ( 2003 ) which has some unbelievable martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiastic .
another amazing scott adkins feature is undisputed 2. check this guy out and make a noise , this guy needs to get super action star status and he needs to get it now !
what else can i say about the movie ?
it 's van damme stepping up a notch from some of his most recent work .
no oscars here for sure , but you already knew that .
but never the less it has a nice little town feel and i could find worse ways to spend my time .
so i 'm giving this a solid 7 out of 10 in it 's genre .
