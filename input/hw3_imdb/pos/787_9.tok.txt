buster keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films , and they do n't come more rib-ticklingly funny than this gem .
the dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic mix-up with a wanted felon .
this leads to his elaborate evasion of several street cops and fellow passengers who recognise the his face from the `` wanted '' signs .
the goat is choc-a-bloc with brilliant site gags , from the opening scene at the bread queue , right up to the wonderful elevator chase at the end .
a keaton film never feels as though its silence is lacking , as sound is never something you needed with him .
his movies explain themselves through the wonderful ( yet incredibly dangerous ) things he did to himself .
it is n't hard to see just how influential he really was - the man is every bit as thoroughly amazing today as he was in 1921 .
