nice movie .
at the begining , i thought it 's a medieve detective kind hi-fi movie , but the ending totally surprised me .
i guess , the whole movie covers too many subjects , each of them can be the main subject , e.g .
avenge , friendship , and dream .
but it mixed all of them without focusing on any of them .
i think , it 'd be a great movie if it 's built around the ending from the very begining .
