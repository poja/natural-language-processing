it 's really good to see van damme 's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to c-grade flops `` derailed '' and `` second in command '' which were both tragic and not in a good way .
the sheperd : border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action/fight sequences .
it 's good to know that van damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film `` until death '' had no martial arts in it at all !
!

that being said , this film is significantly inferior to `` until death '' which was a really good turn for van damme .
`` until death '' lacked the over-the-top action of most van damme films but was dark and gritty and van damme 's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film .
still , the shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for van damme fans or just action movie fans in general but if you 're looking for a film with a bit more story line ... ..you may want to skip this one !
i do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on .
the only real problem i have with this film is the title ; `` the shepherd '' ?
i do n't get it !
i suppose `` border patrol '' just does n't have the same ring to it without the word `` shepherd '' in front of it !
!
!
my rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but that 's by van damme movie standards not in any other film category.i.e .
it 's good for a van damme film .
