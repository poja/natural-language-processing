the director of kannathil muthamittal directed the first indian film i had seen `` dil se '' which led me down the path of buying well over 122 hindi dvds in thecourse of four months .
i can say i understood the total attraction , i wassomehow confused as to why the film would stop for `` music videos '' .
it was an excellent movie , i did n't know what to make of the dancing and the femalevocals were a bit shrill for my western ears , but somehow i found ar rahmen 's score hypnotic .
i bought the soundtrack the following day and then lagan , kuch kuch hota hai and k3g the following week and with the exception of `` ichi thekiller '' a few other korean films , i ca n't be bothered to watch much else .
kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of hong kong , horrorand action/science fiction films for the past 30 years.but i should get back to kannathil muthamittal , it is one of the mani ratman 's latest efforts and i laughed , cried , got totally mad , terrified and most of all i did n't feel manipulated .
the acting was superb , the photography was beautiful , i think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting .
the music fit the movie perfectly and after thecredits rolled , i wanted to watch again ... so i did.it would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop .
this is what great film is all about !
i stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over !
my wife is watching now , and i ca n't wait for her reaction , i ca n't expect it will be anything less than mine .
