to be brief , the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away , but gene kelly , rita hayworth , and an impossibly young phil silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air .
a few of the songs are terrible clunkers ( `` poor john '' is a train wreck ) but most of them are great fun , and the scene of hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for kelly 's rival has to be seen to be believed .
another treat is the perfect faux-nyc sets in the best hollywood tradition.another attraction , if you consider such things attractions , is the howlingly awful male `` chivalry '' toward women .
the oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then ( in the movies , at least ) is presented in its most lurid form here .
some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf.one minor disappointment is eve arden trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything .
i can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and silvers -- a missed opportunity .
