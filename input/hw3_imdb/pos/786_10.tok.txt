a buster keaton silent short.poor buster becomes the goat ( `` scapegoat '' ) for a dangerous escaped murderer.this is a wonderful , hilarious little film with keaton at his absolute best .
in what is essentially a series of chases , buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination .
big joe roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief.born into a family of vaudevillian acrobats , buster keaton ( 1895-1966 ) mastered physical comedy at a very early age .
an association with fatty arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic , silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928. writer , director , star & stuntman - buster could do it all and his intuitive genius gave him almost miraculous knowledge as to the intricacies of film making and of what it took to please an audience .
more akin to fairbanks than chaplin , buster 's films were full of splendid adventure , exciting derring-do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable .
his theme of a little man against the world , who triumphs through bravery & ingenuity , dominates his films .
through every calamity & disaster , buster remained the great stone face , a stoic survivor in a universe gone mad.in the late 1920 's buster was betrayed by his manager/brother-in-law and his contract was sold to mgm , which proceeded to nearly destroy his career .
teamed initially with jimmy durante and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies , buster was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath his talent .
finally , before lung cancer took him at age 70 , he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being rediscovered .
now , well past his centenary , buster keaton is routinely recognized & appreciated as one of cinema 's true authentic geniuses .
and he knew how to make people laugh ...
