anything park chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique , brilliant , and very twisted at a minimum .
well , anything that is n't i 'm a cyborg at least .
park 's newest film titled thirst is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy-drama  yes , that is a lot of adjectives  inspired by the 19th century french novel by emile zola titled therese raquin .
park creates a uniquely korean , and uniquely park , vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a catholic priest discovering himself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop .
park delivers on the elements you would hope but definitely falls short of masterpiece quality like oldboy or even that of lady vengeance .
heavily bloated with a narrative that often loses itself much less the audience , thirst desperately needed another trip through the cutting room .
it crawls when it should be running but luckily brings it back home before losing the audience completely .
as negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted zeitgeist of park chan-wook film.check out the rest of our review at www.thefilmstage.com
