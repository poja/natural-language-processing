this film is superb !
wesley snipes plays blade the vampire hunter with pure class , he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make bruce lee proud .
the movie is a fast paced , thrill ride of action and superb stunts .
the first action scene and last are outstanding and wesley looks like a terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads .
the script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too .
wesley should have done more action films than he has , i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all , only bruce willis , stallone and perhaps tom cruise ( if he counts as an action star ) come close .
also aswell as wesley being quality , steven dorff is also very good as the bad guy .
it was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to snipes should come across as menacing , but he does .
overall the film is sharp , stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace .
