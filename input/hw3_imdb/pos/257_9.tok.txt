watched this film at a local festival , the silver sprocket international film festival florida .
what a lovely film .
a simple , uncomplicated morality tale about a young care free young man having to take responsibility for his actions .
it neither pretentious or flashy my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change i was n't embarrassed by any of the film content or language .
a real family film and the best british comedy film i 've seen since billy elliot.the film went on to win not surprisingly the top festival awards of best film and best director .
ten out of ten .
