this may be the most tension-filled movie i have ever seen.in fact , it 's so nerve-wracking , i have n't been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago , but i will since i have the dvd .
there were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watch ... .so if you 've got problems and need to `` escape '' for an hour-and-half this film will get your mind off anything else .
the russian actress marina zudina did a super job in facial expressions alone , which she had to do since her character in here is a mute .
she plays a cute and wholesome makeup artist for a sleazy filmmaker .
after the day 's shooting is done and `` billie '' is about to leave , she hears something .
she takes a peek into the room where they were filming and discovers they are now shooting a `` snuff film '' and actually killing someone .
billie 's eavesdropping is discovered and she runs for her life as the killers go searching for her in this big warehouse-type building.there are two extended scenes in which our heroine is running for her life and both of them will wear you out .
the first i described above .
the second scene , the climactic one , goes on too long and is n't as well done as the first .
in fact , the film should have been trimmed a bit but , overall , since it 's so good at keeping our attention , then it served its purpose as entertainment .
