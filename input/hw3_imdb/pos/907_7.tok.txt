this is one of l & h 's shorts most frequently cited as the first `` real '' l & h teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features .
j. piedmont mumblethunder ( ollie ) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew philip , whom he 's never seen .
at first ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he 's behaving during his medical exam , but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow he 's supposed to be greeting .
he has been told that philip is a good boy , but he has one weakness -- women .
mumblethunder and philip set off to go home , but their journey there is continually interrupted by philip breaking into a little dance every time he sees a woman , then chasing after the woman .
huge crowds gather each time this happens , not so much because he 's chasing skirts , but because philip himself is also wearing a skirt ( a kilt ) .
finally mumblethunder manages to drag philip into a tailor 's shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants , but philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts .
there are lots of laughs all around .
it 's also nice to see a short like this because the boys are n't exactly the characters we know and love .
ollie is pretty much his usual character , but it 's such a joy to see stan acting so differently from his usual man-child character .
it shows he was n't a one-trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when he got the chance .
with a run time of 19 minutes its short and sweet , providing classic one liners which still have me in stitches .
