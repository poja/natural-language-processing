given that dylan thomas is an icon of modern anglophone poetry i expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject .
on the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible , a drunkard , a bad father , a lier and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward .
of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality but still i do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits .
any way i found the other male hero of the story captain cillic a more endearing character .
the two female roles were played by actresses knigtley and miller and were truly charming especially the first when she performed songs in slim outfit to inspire bombarded londoners during ww2 .
another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays even in relatively progressive milieus that think that age-old conventions can easily be surpassed.the atmosphere of the blitz was also convincing as well as the portrayal of the distinct outlooks among people who have experienced war as opposed to those who talk about it theorizing on it 's possible political outcomes.i think one would recommend such a movie .
