with that , carry the same dark weaknesses we all unfortunately possess : lying , deception , laziness , the list goes on.however , as an american , i was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in today 's police force as is reflected with the duval county sheriff department 's horrible detective and police work with the murder of a white female tourist and a 15-year old accused black youth .
i shook my head in shame that detectives were protected from their abusive work while a young man 's life hung in the crooked balance of justice.however , there is also a story of hope with our judicial system and how poorly-paid public defenders stuck by their guns ( irony intended ) and forced the truth from the detectives .
i wanted to fly down to florida and tell anybody with influence what a great public defender team they have in duval county ; those lawyers care about the `` little '' man and , most importantly , for justice.the other story line is about faith and family .
praises to the accused 's family and their strong christian ( submit any dedicated religion ) beliefs and wonderful family values .
i hope they win their lawsuit against the duval county sheriff 's department.bravo for justice !
