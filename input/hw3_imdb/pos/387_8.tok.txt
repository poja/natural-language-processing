even though some unrealistic things happen at the end ( i.e .
a cop shooting a gun into a crowded merry-go-round where any number of innocent could be killed ) , this still was an intense , enjoyable thriller , one of alfred hitchcock 's better films .
robert walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase , really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times .
his co-star in here , farley granger , is okay but is no match for walker , either in acting or in the characters they play .
it 's the typical hitchcock film with some strange camera angles , immoral themes , innocent man gets in trouble , etc .
unlike a lot of his other films , i thought this one was a fast-moving story with a very few dull spots .
being an ex-tennis player , i enjoyed his footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies .
hitchcock 's real-life daughter patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here .
she did n't just get the job because of her dad ; she can act .
also of note : the dvd has both the british and american versions and there were some differences in the story .
this is a classic film that is still referred to in modern-day films , even comedies such as `` throw momma off the train . ''
