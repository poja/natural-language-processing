i first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time .
the opening narrative , music and paintings by norman rockwell set the tone for me .
you either love the movie or hate it .
jan michael vincent was at his all time best and portrayed cpl marion hedgepeth in a most innocent and touching way .
this movie is at the top of my all time favorites , a shame it is n't available on dvd or vhs anymore .
the ending was also wonderful .
john hancock did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time .
