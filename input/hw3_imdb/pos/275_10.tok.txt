i like many others saw this as a child and i loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood , i have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on tv someday , since it originally played on usa networks .
does anyone know where to buy this movie , or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me ?
also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on tv again ?
maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again .
i do n't think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about , people only know of the stepford wives and stepford husband movies .
no one is familiar with the fact that there was a children version .
maybe they should also do a re-make of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thriller/horror flicks .
well if anyone has any input please i beg of you write me with information .
