like some other people wrote , i 'm a die-hard mario fan , and i loved this game .
this game starts slightly boring , but trust me , it 's worth it .
as soon as you start , your hooked !
the levels are fun and exiting .
they will hook you 'till your mind turns to mush .
i 'm not kidding .
this game is also orchestrated , and is beautifully done .
to keep this spoiler free , i have to keep my mouth shut about details .
but please try this game !
it 'll be worth it !
