i ca n't understand why imdb users would rate this movie 5.2/10 ?
it really is great , very funny .
i would strongly recommend this movie for all of you , adults , teenagers and especially children !
the story is about a 14-year-old kid who always tell lie , at home and school .
one day he had his homework of writing a 1000-word-story .
but he did n't , so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours , or he would have to go to summer school .
yep , he wrote it in 2:45 .
`` big fat liar '' , i think it was a story of himself .
on the way to the school he hit a limo of a famous hollywood producer , and he gave him a ride .
but the kid forgot the story in the limo .
he told his parents and the teacher , but of course , they did not believe him .
and the movie producer , he took the kid 's story as his new movie , `` big fat liar '' .
when the kid saw the trailer of the movie , he told his parents he had written it , but they did n't believe .
so , he and his friend had to go to l.a to prove one thing : the truth is never overrated enjoy this great movie , you wo n't be disappointed .
do n't trust the 5.2/10 rate , it should be 9/10 !
believe me !
p/s : so sorry , my english is n't good enough to make a better comment !
