i caught this at the chicago indiefest and have to say you are alone is a lot funnier than the other reviews and even the website would lead you to think .
not ha ha wedding crashers ' funny , but sick , twisted , i ca n't believe she just said that but it 's so damn true funny.jessica bohl , who deservedly won best actress , is amazing to watch .
there 's never a moment when you think oh , i 'm watching a movie and she 's an actress .
she 's too damn real for words.in fact there 's 2 scenes that i 'm still giggling over , and i wo n't give them away , but in one she 's in the bathroom talking about how much she gets paid for performing a certain service and how `` awesome '' it is .
( i almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing !
!
! )
in another she talks about a teenagers definition of `` sex '' versus an adults , and if it is n't the truest dialog i 've heard in a movie in a long time , i do n't know what is .
