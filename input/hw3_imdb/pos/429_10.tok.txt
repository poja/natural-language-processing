it seems that hack has been described as un-realistic ... but that 's what tv is .
tv is meant to provide an escape from everyday life and i feel hack does a great job in that regard .
add to this the slow process of revealing his past and engaging/interesting plots ; you just ca n't seem to get enough .
plus , with such great actors as david morse , andre braugher , and even little mathew borish , what more can you ask for .
so if you are looking for an involving experience and have a liking for `` underdog '' characters , i suggest giving hack a chance , especially now that it 's finally getting off its feet .
