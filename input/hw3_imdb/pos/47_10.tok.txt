lackawanna blues is and excellent movie .
the casting was perfect .
every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played .
their chemistry together was amazing .
the acting was superb .
i felt as if i knew the characters .
i could almost 'feel ' them .
they reminded me of people that i knew as a child growing up in the 50 's and 60 's .
oh , the memories !
!
my personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see .
i have watched this movie so many times , that i can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them .
i ca n't even list my favorite part , because i have so many favorite parts .
thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that i never see in this day and age ... and that is black people loving each other , looking out for each other , respecting each other , caring about each other , and doing all we can to help each other .
got ta go now .
i have to go watch it again .
