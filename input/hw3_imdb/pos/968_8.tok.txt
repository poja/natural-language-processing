big fat liar is a great watch for kids of all ages , even adults .
i had a great time watching this movie and recommend this to kids of 10 years and under .
the laughs never end and the adventurous plot is pretty good too !
frankie muniz is funny and marty wolfe is hilarious !
overall , a nicely made film for kids to enjoy and just have a great time .
