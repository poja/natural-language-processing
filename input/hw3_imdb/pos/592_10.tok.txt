i am 17 , and a biased muppet fan , and while i love treasure island , christmas carol and great muppet caper , the muppet movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them .
it is enormously entertaining , thanks to the snappy script by jerry juhl , and the film looks lovely , with some beautifully staged musical numbers .
speaking of the songs , i really liked them , sure they are n't the best song score out of the muppet franchise , but they were very nice to listen to , especially never before .
never before is now one of my favourite muppet songs along with first time it happens and professional pirate .
the muppets as usual were fantastic , particularly the always delightful miss piggy , and the chemistry between kermit and fozzie was great .
and what a brilliant human cast- from bob hope to orson welles , from madeleine kahn ( the same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like what 's up doc ?
, blazing saddles and clue ) to cloris leachman , from steve martin to richard pryor , all of whom made memorable guest appearances , if careful not to overshadow the muppets in a fantastic film .
