interesting twist on the vampire yarn - fast , loud and moody .
despite my initial fears kris k carries his part reasonably well and snipes aka blade provides a formidable physical presence .
lots of blood , steel , silver , burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable : ) 110 minute distraction .
if you like the black look of the matrix then blade will appeal to you , blade even has a 'dodge the bullets ' sequence .
