`` shivering shakespeare '' could be considered the first classic of the `` our gang '' talkie era .
by now , hal roach studios began to hit their stride in making talking pictures , and `` shakespeare '' is the happy result.the gang is appearing in a version of quo vadis produced by kennedy the cop 's wife .
the kids do n't find the play very fun to be in and are distracted by people in the theatre and can not remember their lines .
among the funniest bits are kennedy the cop as the giant , who pulls off his makeup to fight an overzealous man in a bull costume ; and the terrible dancing girl ( played by director bob mcgowan 's daughter . )
several filmographies mention that `` shakespeare '' has the first pie fight in a talkie .
this may be true , seeing as they tried different speeds with the film during the fight .
buster keaton 's brother harry is at the receiving end of one of the pies .
very funny and an early gang talkie classic .
9 out of 10 .
