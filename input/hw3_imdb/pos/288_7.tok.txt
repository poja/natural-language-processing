one thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun/exciting for the cast and crew ; i could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm & dedication because they apparently liked the people involved .
i tend to like b movies that are original and have heart , and i think this is one such work .
the actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual , maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress/director , and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent , watchable piece of art .
the critiques of this film that more or less say , `` why not just rent a hardcore porn movie , '' make the point as to why they did n't like the film .
going to this film hoping for a lot of t & a without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so unenjoyable for them .
one could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie , even though i take it the star has done her share of soft porn .
i think she graduated .
in terms of the writing , the dialog is not a huge part of the movie , like in a tarentino film , but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun .
particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure , with the villianess/heroine and the `` leading man '' learning from their complex web of feelings .
i understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this .
hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride .
gabriella and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot , not just airhead bimbos , so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art , even with the limits of b-movie land , not disappointing .
