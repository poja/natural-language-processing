look , this movie is obscure , brilliant , and a classic that should sought out by any means necessary .
i suppose the powers that be have decided that it will forever be relegated towards the bargin bin ; nevertheless , we could only pray for the chance to see this one on dvd .
i would say that it even beats the great phatasm .
if you like a dark movie , with plenty of spooky imagery , look for this one and see how an 80s horror movie is suppose to be .
