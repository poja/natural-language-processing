not all , but most of this story is buster being mistaken for `` dead shot dan , '' a notorious criminal .
there really is no story , just a series of adventures to show off buster 's physical talents , which are amazing , and his comedic timing .
the 27-minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our hero.earlier , it 's a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later it 's `` big joe '' roberts , a rotund cop - and father a girl buster is interested in - who chases him .
those latter scenes were the best i thought , with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live .
that was keaton at his best.it 's just a madcap half hour that makes little sense , but cares ?
it 's buster at his slapstick best , or near it , and so it serves its purpose : to entertain us .
just think : 85 years after this film was made there are people ( like me ) still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics !
cool !
