i remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out , having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that i vowed to buy the video when it came out .
while i wo n't go too far into dissecting this film , i will say that i gave it an 8/10 , for all the reasons you can read in the other user 's reviews.what i will say is this : the first 10 minutes of this film are incredible .
it 's as close to a textbook audience grabber as i 've ever seen .
i once put this movie on at a party , where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave .
i just wanted to see what would happen if i showed them the first ten minutes.everyone , who watched the opening , stayed to the end .
