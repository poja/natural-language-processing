this is one of those games where you love it to bits or hate it to shreds.even being a hardcore mario fan can make you dislike this game.you can hate it because it is 2 short and somewhat boring and easy.or you can love it because it is a mixture of amazing graphics ( not a nintendo fan huge excitement ) music or game play.i know a lot of people that say it is amazing , and others who think its the worst mario ever.it really depends on the type of nintendo fan you are.i personally love this game and i think it is the best wii game , but you should determine that for yourself.so i think you should absolutely get it if you are the right nintendo fan.but if you love the classics too much , you may not like it.so try it out yourself .
