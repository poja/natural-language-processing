any film about wwii made during wwii by a british production company has no latter-day peer in my opinion , respectfully .
the confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in at dawn we dive : as a descendant of admiral horatio nelson and student of all aspects of world war two and particularly naval warfare , i favor depictions of subs and action in the north atlantic and especially those which include the german side of things .
for those unacquainted with target priorities , an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here .
the pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the ealing , rank and british-gaumont studios back in the day : frankly i prefer its quieter , more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over-produced hollywood movie ever could .
this reminds me of powell and pressburger 's the 49th parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive eric portman , a favorite of mine .
john mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles , so this is clearly meant to be mr. portman 's film but the whole cast shines .
as for the title sequence , am i the only one who is utterly charmed by gainsborough production 's lovely pre-cgi gainsborough girl ?
