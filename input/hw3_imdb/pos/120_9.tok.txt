there are questions that sometimes hover over us and have no answer .
two women progressively find themselves ensnared in each other 's arms ( as corny as the expression sounds , that is exactly what happens ) and fins that they can not answer their own question as to what defines their relationship when their very own society has no name to what they are .
deepa mehta 's somewhat mis-titled fire is the first of a loosely connected trilogy , here linked by the theme of the elements , and more symbolic than consuming .
fire as uncontrolled erotic passion does not make an appearance here , since the women -- the older and more feminine radha ( shabana azmi ) and the younger , more masculine tempered sita ( nandita das ) come to realize they share a lot more than common ideas and affection for each other and stand for what they believe is their passion for each other despite the opposition faced by their very traditional husbands and families .
as in water , fire is deeply spiritual , even if it technically falls into the mode of sentimental melodrama ( where water , much like the weight of the word , carries a stronger meaning that ultimately transcends its definition ) .
even so , it 's a very beautiful picture , and a strong voice from a strong director .
