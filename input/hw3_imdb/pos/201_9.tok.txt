a true masterpiece of the soviet cinematography .
it 's a shame for the soviet union that samojlova was never given an opportunity to play in the western movies -- but then again , she would probably never find herself there .
in `` letyat zhuravli '' , she is unforgettable .
this was one of the few movies where i was crying ... in addition to samojlova , batalov and merkurjev , who are top rate , it was a brilliant work of the director and the operator which made this movie an all-time classics world-wide .
just remember the scenes of piano music and proposal under the heavy german bombardment , or the death of boris with a swirling sky above his head and his last visions appeared blurred in those skies .
the very simple means -- but the great technique added to the emotional weight ... mind you , 20 years before `` the star wars '' , 41 years before `` titanic '' , and with a soviet budget .
