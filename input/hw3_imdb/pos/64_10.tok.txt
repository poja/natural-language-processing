darling lili is a mixture of perfection and magic !
the stars ; julie andrews & rock hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried .
it 's full of all the magic that a young lady wishes for and it makes it seem as if it can all really happen to you .
the brilliance of the director ; blake edwards is shown to be at his best .
he was truly capturing the woman he loved on screen !
the blend of each song , went perfectly with the moment in the film .
the film opened with julie andrews singing whistling away in the dark and closed with the same song by andrews.for a film of this excellence to have been such a failure when it was released , is a total shock ... as it is : `` inspirational ... purely ... .inspirational ! ''
~one of andrews most memorable lines in this film !
