there have been many excellent comments about this movie and i want to add my voice to the praise .
yul brynner has never been more powerfully attractive .
his major surov was riveting .
your eyes just can not leave the screen when he 's on it .
this is his movie .
this is not to slight the rest of the cast which was also exemplary , especially deborah kerr and anne jackson .
as they were mostly stage actors , they brought many nuances to their performances .
for example , i have seen this movie at least 4 times , but this is the first time i noticed the reaction of the german girl when she came face-to-face with a russian soldier .
even though he was not threatening , her absolutely hysterical reaction made me realize that she must have been in germany after wwii and was most likely gang-raped by the red army .
the possibility of discovering deeper layers of story that may lie just beneath the surface makes me want to see this fascinating film again and again .
please put it on dvd .
