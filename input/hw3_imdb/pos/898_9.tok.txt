i have so much hope for the sequel to gen-x .
luckily , my hopes have came true .
you got a whole bunch of action , comedy ... silly comedy , and surprises .
i think the newcomer edison , is really a hit in the movie , but i really find sam 's 'alien ' stupidly annoying with english .
although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue , the action always keeps it strong .
the action set-up is much stronger than the 1st.this movie is getting more of an american feel since 60 % of the movie is in english from the cantonese .
this movie will not disappoint you .
i recommended this for young 'uns that care about pure action-packed fun .
