this is definitely one of the most scary and spell-binding films ever made .
you are stuck to the movie from the beginning to the very end .
even though there are some plot holes , it keeps being exciting to the final showdown .
besides `` 8 mm '' and `` peeping tom '' this is one of the best films about `` snuff movies '' , a taboo theme of our culture .
if you like the scream trilogy , you will probably love that one .
