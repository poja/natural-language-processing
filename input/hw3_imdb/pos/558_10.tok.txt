a must see documentary.
-- -- -this movie had so many things to consider while watching it .
it was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named brenton butler .
he accused of killing a white tourist in florida .
it shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed his wife .
the husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing .
the police little to investigate the crime .
brenton 's lawyer patrick mcguinness is meticulous in getting information to help his client .
he tells the viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use on the police to show their incomplete investigation and beatings against his young client to get him to confess .
the camera goes with mcguinness to where brenton was questioned .
mcguinness also takes pictures of the room and how the audio is monitored .
he questions a policeman on the stand and ask what the heard brenton say to one of the investigators and he challenges their own words .
mcguinness investigates with ann finnell each place the police should have gone and the things they should have done but did not .
the movie shows the butlers as a loving christian family who have faith in their son 's innocence and faith that god will set brenton free .
they visit him in jail and pray with him there to encourage him .
there are scenes of group prayer for brenton , the lawyers , the judge and everyone involved in this case .
i am a white and i was surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treat other blacks .
it was very disappointing to see black and white police stick together when they think they got their man .
police have a hard job and i believe most of them are honorable not like the ones in this movie .
i think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the judicial system including judges , police and lawyers and even potential jurors to watch this movie and learn from it .
