this movie is a mystery .
it 's not scary , it 's spooky .
you 'll probably jump at some points and for some of it you 'll be scratching your head to figure it out .
it unfolds its mystery through the main character eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum , don .
he needs her to search for some clues to vindicate himself from murdering his mother , and once eve agrees to help him , she completely opens up pandora 's box and unleashes some very strange things , including malachi .
i wo n't go into malachi , but i thought the way that played out was complete genius .
i know movie buffs wo n't regard this movie with the same prestige as other classics because it does n't have anyone very famous in it ( angelina jolie 's brother was excellent , but maybe he should have asked his sister to show her face just so this movie could get some recognition ) but i do think the way the malachi ending works is something to talk about .
i 've recommended this to my friends , definitely worth the purchase or rental price .
