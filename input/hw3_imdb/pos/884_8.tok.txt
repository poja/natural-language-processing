although i saw this movie in korea , in korean , and therefore did not understand the language , images sure say more than enough .
from what i can make of it , this is the story : two superb sword fighters become friends in their service as the king 's guard .
one of them finds himself opposed to the ways of the king and starts assassinating important men .
the other has to hunt him down .
this movie is visually great .
the swordfighting is great .
and the movie has a gripping end .
i just hope this movie will be marketed for the western cinema goers .
and be released on dvd , of course .
