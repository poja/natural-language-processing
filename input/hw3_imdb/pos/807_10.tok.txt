excellent work all around especially by the actress who played the wife gerda ( claire price ) as well , of course , as david suchet .
i did really figure out whodunit but that is beside the point .
the ending , which i wo n't divulge ( someone describes it on the board in answer to someone else 's question if you are interested . )
i found really sad .
despite agatha christie 's reputation for writing cardboard characters , i thought these really well-rounded by and large.the pacing of the story was good and i enjoyed seeing sarah miles as lucy and edward hardwicke ( cedric 's son i believe in addition to being a well-known dr .
watson . )
) as her husband .
