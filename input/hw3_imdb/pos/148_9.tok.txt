'oldboy ' director park chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history.trusting the latest hollywood fad , vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent , asexual , love-lorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood-sucking mind-manipulating man-beasts of yore .
this is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past ... well , at least in the second half .
'thirst ' starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story .
the vampire transformation of a priest is , over quite some time , sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story , which makes for some awkward viewing .
but the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly gory .
well , maybe not so surprisingly if you know 'oldboy ' and 'i 'm a cyborg but that 's ok ' , but i guess it 's fair to say that 'thirst ' beats park 's earlier films in terms of in-your-face violence .
all in all , be warned that this is neither art cinema nor a horror flick .
it may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some .
'thirst ' is original , entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than park chun-wook 's earlier endeavors .
