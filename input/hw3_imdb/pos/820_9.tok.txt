when i first got wind of this picture , it was just called `` shepherd '' and was supposed to be the film that would put jcvd back into chances of doing theatrical shtuff .
i was very well excited about the whole piece.by the time it was titled `` the shepherd : border patrol , '' i was tap-dancing in excitement for this flick .
with isaac fluorentine at the helm of directing , and jj perry pulling stunt coordination , i almost peed me pants in anticipation .
pics were released of jcvd kicking 8 different kinds of arse as well as scott adkins playing what i thought was the villain , and i was mind-blown in excitement .
i thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like lone wolf mcquade.then it came out .
i ordered it off blockbuster online for $ 20 and was ready for anything .
the reviews from vandammefan.net kinda had my ideas alittle altered , but i braced myself .
the mail came on day 4 and i ripped open the package .
my initial plan was to rush upstairs , rip the face off the cardboard packaging , then smash the case in the proper dynamics so the disc would land in my dvd player .
however , i stared at the case for 10 minutes then placed the disc in my player and watched the film.by the time it was over , i was cool as a fool in the pool .
the shepherd is certainly one of my all-time favorite direct-to-video films ever and makes derailed look like even more of the toilet mess that it is .
sure , some of the fights ran a twee bit short , but they were still very awesome .
the shootouts were superb , as was scott adkins , who should have been the villain , unlike the forgettable steven lord.i highly recommend this flick .
seriously .
