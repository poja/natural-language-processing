see three colors : blue and three colors : white .
they are both wonderful films and will give an added dimension to the finale three colors : red .
red is a fantastic film .
it can be enjoyed in a single viewing , and indeed , the climax of the film is very powerful in that first viewing .
but , watch it again .
once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie , you will see new things with each viewing .
with the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind .
with each additional viewing , you find yourself discovering that it is , in fact , a work of genius .
red is meant to symbolize fraternity in the french flag .
the story turns the theme of fraternity around to be viewed at angles one would never suspect .
the facets of fraternity shared by the different characters is as deep as you care to peer .
if you are used to the blatant `` symbolism '' in most mass films , you may find red a bit slow .
you may find yourself looking at a screen filled with intensity that you do not fathom ... and yawning , wonder what all the excitement is about .
this is not a mindless , vicarious experience .
everything is not explained to you .
you must think as you watch .
you must see ... not simply look .
wonderful movie ... one meant to be enjoyed by a wonderful moviegoer .
