this must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time .
the kind of title that ruins a film because it neither evokes the plot nor the characters .
a title like this makes a film flop , even the french title is not much better .
too bad - truffaut & deneuve must have been enough to sell it..this is a long film , but largely worth it .
clearly influenced by hitchcock , we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride , her rich husband , a theft , an identity switch , and obsessive love .
the plot here is actually very good , and takes us on an unexpected trip.the thing that works both for and against the movie is the focus on the relationship .
it is an interesting study in how these plot developments are played out in `` real life relationship '' with these two people .
unfortunately , this is what bogs the film down , and makes it ultimately dissatisfying .
we do like films to have a real sense of finality , and that is missing here.it was the case in many of her films that deneuve became a canvas for directors to play their fantasies out on , and this time it does n't work as well .
messy here , is the fact that the director clearly just wanted to have deneuve take her top off a few times .
deneuve is an actress who always seems very deliberate and thoughtful , so these attempts to make her seem spontaneous fall flat .
basically , the script needed to be worked out better before shooting began , to make this film tighter and shorter and to snap .
but truffaut did n't snap , did he ?
so - it wanders a bit , but remains interesting .
