the subject is world war ii and robert ryan is a rejected soldier whom lupino hires as handyman .
she is a war widow.the set is limited but the acting makes up for this .
robert ryan is conflicted : one moment he seems nice , then confused about where he lives .
at first lupino tries to help him .
he seems troubled but nothing more dangerous .
but how do we know ?
the suspense builds .
i truly enjoy films like this , which rely on the human element for suspense .
what is this man capable of ?
.
there are some scenes with o.z .
whitehead and dee pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees something is wrong .
we keep thinking she will be helped , then ryan 's personality turns again .
he becomes like a jekyll/hyde character and eventually chases lupino with a knife.worth watching for these two superb actors .
9/10 .
