adam sandler 's movies are my favorite comedies .
the silence of the lambs is my favorite horror movie .
the matrix is my favorite sci-fi movie .
anywhere but here is my favorite drama.perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is it 's acting.susan sarandon is absolutely amazing .
by the end of this movie i felt as if i knew her character better than i knew myself .
she did a simply amazing job.natalie portman also did a great job .
i recently rented her first movie , leon ( 1994 ) , in which she played a 12 year old girl .
i believe that she is a contradiction in terms ; she was a good kid actress .
well , 5 years later she is still just as good an actress .
in fact , she 's much better.not only did sarandon and portman portray their characters well , but they also worked perfectly together .
i mean , even now i can hardly believe that they are not actually mother and daughter in real life as well as in this movie.this movie is about a 14 year old girl ( portman ) and her restless mother ( sarandon ) that leave their home town in wisconsin for beverly hills.at first portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends , and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that goes up and down over the course of a couple years ( usually down , might i add ) .although this explanation is a little vague , the plot can only be summarized vaguely .
but when you see this movie you will see that the plot really is not so vague or weak , for it is actually very deep .
what i am saying is that the plot is outlined weakly , but then they focus in on it to make it strong.and it is very strong , but also the plot sequencing is great .
and there are a few brilliant scenes that i hope will someday be seen as `` classic '' .i loved this movie .
i laughed .
i cried .
and although , admittedly , there are a few loopholes , it 's still a stellar movie and it really comes together in the end .
