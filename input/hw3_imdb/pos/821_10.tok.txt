van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books .
from the setting of mexico to the five star fight scenes , this movie was amazing .
the film is all about border patrol officers protecting there territory which is the border of mexico .
ex navy seals are smuggling drugs out of mexico into the united states of america ( usa ) , van damme and scott atkins give stunning performances as the cop and the villain .
although this film was n't as good as until death but it still gave the action , acting and the film a five star look .
i always look forward to these b grade action films and they keep getting better .
keep them coming van damme.watch this film if you enjoyed films like - until death , the hard corps and second in command .
