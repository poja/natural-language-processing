this is a movie that will brighten up your day , for sure .
kermit the frog , is just an ordinary frog in his swamp , when a talent agent stops by and tells him that hollywood is looking for frogs to be in movie ( lol ) .
on the way , kermit meets fozzie bear , miss piggy , gonzo and his chicken camilla , rowlf , the electric mayhem , bunsen honeydew and beaker .
but also trailing kermit is the proprietor of a restaurant chain , doc hoppers french fried frog legs .
all things considered though , kermit and the muppets make it to hollywood.this movie is recommended for everyone , young and old.it has some wonderful musical numbers , like `` the rainbow connection , `` i 'm going to go back there someday , '' and `` movin ' right along . ''
the muppets also use many forms of transportation in this movie .
kermit rides a bike , fozzie drives a studebaker , and another car , gonzo takes flight with a bundle of helium balloons , ( which is one of my favorite moments by the way ; ) ) , and kermit and the rest of the muppets finally go the rest of the way by the electric mayhem 's bus ( dr. teeth , floyd , janice , scooter , and animal ) ; who meet up with them in the desert after fozzie 's car breaks down.even some sesame street muppets make cameo appearances ( i.e .
big bird is walking along on the road , on the way to nyc to break into public television ) .
the end is also a very heartwarming moment .
every single muppet created is in the final scene , along with a final `` rainbow connection '' reprise.but those poor muppets worked so hard on their movie set , then it all comes crashing down , and the camera explodes in a huge ball of sparks .
you 'd think everything is ruined and destroyed , but the rainbow comes shining through the roof at the end , and it all sums up the magic of this film , and you know everything will be all right.perfect 10/10 .
watch it , and you 'll be enchanted by the fun and sadness of this movie .
