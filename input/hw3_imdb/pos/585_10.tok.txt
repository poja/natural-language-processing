`` why are there so many songs about rainbows , and what 's on the other side ? ''
kermit poses this relatively simple double interrogative near the beginning of `` the muppet movie '' while singing his signature song , `` the rainbow connection . ''
as time goes by , the question and the movie only gain profundity.i 'm going to forgo the review of this movie as a children 's comedy , but look at it instead as a classic for every generation to love with serious ideals and a heartwarming message that gains more warmth with each passing year.as the milestones in my own life come creeping up on me , i hear more and more the evocative strains of that elementary ditty , and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to anyone 's life , because we all dream .
and that is what this movie is about .
it 's not just a bunch of puppets -- it 's a bunch of puppets having the strength to pursue their dreams , which is a good lesson for everyone.and while the humor and mirth of the film always feel good , they 're not a fair judge of the movie .
only `` the rainbow connection '' and the powerful emotions it will realize .
and it all fits in : `` rainbow connection '' *is* the muppet movie , and vice versa .
it 's existentialism meets children 's entertainment -- there 's no simpler way to describe it .
