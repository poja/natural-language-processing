i watched this on hbo because it won the oscar a week earlier .
it compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas.the story is of a 15-year-old black kid placed on trial for the jacksonville , fl , murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victim 's husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced.about half the footage is of the trial ; it 's supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers ( two public defenders ) explaining their case , interviewing witnesses , and visiting key locations .
this is edited with a minimum of needless repetition , and placed in logical order .
the camera work is pretty solid .
and there 's a mildly surprising epilogue .
