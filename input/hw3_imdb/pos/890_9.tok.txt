with all due respect to joel fabiani and rosemary nicolls and their characters , department s will be forever associated with peter wyngarde 's jason king.most people remember him as this camp , flamboyant and debonair womaniser cum detective in the mould of austin powers but that will do a disservice to the character : he 's far more nuanced than that.jason king is lazy ( he often lets stewart fight all the bad guys and only chips in at the end ) , he is egotistical ( his appreciation of people is based on whether they 've read his novels or not ) , a lot of his detective work is speculation without facts to back them up and he sulks whenever annabelle is right ... and she often is .
he 's clearly a man having a mid-life crisis and drink drives but ... ... .jason king is brilliant .
if wyngarde had played him purely as a dashing hero , it would n't have worked but he shows king often as a paper tiger , led by his libido , love of finery and prone to grandstanding ( and it gets in the way of his detective work at times ) but he has some of the best lines and put downs in tv history .
and by not playing him as whiter-than-white , the chemistry and interactions between the three lead characters is all the better for it.watching it again on dvd recently , you get to see just how much depth wyngarde put into jason king .
