this has to be one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen .
the idea of a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the wilderness .
when mom and dad both lose there jobs , not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub .
they decide it 's in their families best interest to move to oregon .
once there everything goes wrong .
an interesting cast of characters compliment this movie .
including a young molly ringwald , this a movie i would definetly recommend .
