this film is absolute gold .
if you have n't seen it , do .
mani ratnam outdoes himself once again .
this film introduced me to nandita das as well , though everyone shines in this movie .
my only regret is i 've never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs .
we are led from the jungle of northern sri lanka to the serene beaches of southern india , as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest by love of the human heart .
beautiful , subtle , witty , with a few hidden surprises waiting for the viewer , this movie stands up to being seen again and again , and the story within the story , the umbrella , is done so well , as we watch the scene unfold from drawings in a book .
lovely .
watch it .
