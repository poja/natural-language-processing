you know , before seeing this film i had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases .
i mean if they were arrested and charged , `` they must have been guilty '' i reasoned ?
i formed this opinion over some years .
you see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of sydney .
he frequently complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to 'bleeding heart ' lawyers and magistrates .
he would `` bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be `` back on the street by noon '' .
it took its toll ... they wore him down .
he quit.he has argued since , not unreasonably i thought , that creative evidence gathering , to keep the baddies `` where they belong '' , was ... well ... `` acceptable '' .
my arguments about the rights of innocent people were n't valid he claimed .
`` what are the chances that you will ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime '' ?
he would argue .
and , being a law abiding citizen , the weight of his argument convinced me he was right .
the chances of me , or any of my family or friends , being charged with murder or a serious offense were zero to none i thought .
hmmmmm .
well as mentioned earlier , seeing this wonderfully enlightening documentary changed all that .
i 'm sending him a copy .
