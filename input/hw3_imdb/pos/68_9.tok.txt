julie andrews and rock hudson were great in this movie / musical .
the opening song by ms. andrews , `` whistling away the dark , '' will always be in the back roads of my mind .
the plot line during world war i , is great and suspenseful one .
if you are a romantic , you will love this movie .
this is a movie that i always enjoy to see again and again .
