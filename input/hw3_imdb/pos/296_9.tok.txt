i have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect .
and it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie .
i mean you just have to love robert duval , marlon brando , martin sheen and lauerence fishburne in this movie but specially duval .
i can not believe that kramer vs. kramer did win an oscar in stead of this amazing war movie .
so this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( the godfather ) and the best of hollywood actors you can only succeed .
now i just have to writhe something to get this preview so do not read this except the last line .
this movie rules !
