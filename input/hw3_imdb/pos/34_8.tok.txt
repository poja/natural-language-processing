lackawanna blues is a touching story about nanny , a woman who gives all of herself to help those in need .
it 's told from the viewpoint of a boy , taken in by nanny when his own mother is n't quite up to the task.i have respect for this movie for three main reasons : 1 ) it is touching , but not sappy .
it 's told in a very real fashion , without a lot of the aggravating hollywood storytelling baggage .
and the ending is quite good ( teary but not over-the-top ) .2 ) although it 's clearly an african-american film , being set in the post-segregation black community of lackawanna , new york , it does n't wear its ethnicity on its sleeve .
the story stands on the strength of the characters and the dramas ( and comedies ) surrounding their lives .
it 's not preachy , it 's simply good.3 ) it has a great soundtrack ( ca n't beat old-school r & b and chicago blues ) .generally the acting is strong , but not universally so .
some of the performances simply do n't hold up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray .
but considering it was a made-for-tv movie , that 's to be expected.8 out of 10. imperfect but likable , good film for a rainy day .
