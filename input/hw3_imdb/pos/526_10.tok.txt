never , ever , have i been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of people , that faces a crisis , or many .
in some ways a little like short cuts , but totally different , at the same time.there are a heap of lead characters , whom we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold , and they are , as persons show their good and their bad sides , their weaknesses and their strengths , with lots of drama and laughter.the closest equivalent in a us movie , i can think of , which then is far weaker in every respect , is the royal tenenbaums .
four shades of brown , as the title would be in english , tells the story about a stressed out hotelier and his wife , and his elderly parents ( who are traveling magicians ) ; about the receptionist at an animal crematory and his family misadventures ; about the members of a cooking course ( who mostly talk about their sorry lives ) and fourthly about the funeral for a womanizing trotter jockey , who tries to continue orchestrating the family from beyond the grave , by singing and appearing in 3d during the funeral , thanks to high tech equipment that has cost his entire fortune ( the family gets nil , not even the famous horse is given to the family ) !
there is a warmth and compassion in this film , that is filled with grief and laughter , that i 've never experienced before.most actors were new to me , except robert gustafsson and one or two more , but they all deserve the big slam the film took at the swedish guldbagge extravaganza ( = the swedish `` oscar '' awards ) a week ago !
male , female and male supporting actor prizes went to this film , plus a few more , to boot !
if you have the chance , go and see it - the hours float by very quickly !
