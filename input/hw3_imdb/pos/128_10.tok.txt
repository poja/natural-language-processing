it 's worth boning up on the hindu pantheon before watching this film .
three main female deities -- wise sita , nurturing lakshmi and kali the transformer -- as well as three main male deities -- grave rama , playful krishna and shiva the ender -- are all alluded to .
knowing the folklore as surely every indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the present-day story .
in fact , one folktale is enacted first on stage , as part of a lesson in spirituality , and then in the movie 's `` real life . ''
`` fire '' speaks out against the misogyny and homophobia in the society to which its producers are native , and it does so with a beauty that weaves the message into multiple levels of the viewer 's awareness , making it a deeply satisfying presentation .
this is the finest film i 've seen in the past ten years ; very highly recommended !
