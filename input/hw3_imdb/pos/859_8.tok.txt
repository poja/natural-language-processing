i saw the film yesterday and really enjoyed it.although there were several clues which i could realize after second time watching , i was not able to awake the dow-dawn case .
maybe this was my carelessness.the subconsciousness of a woman was became concrete with personalization .
'let me go out'the key sentence of the film.let me go out from deep deep inside of your brain and we will both be free.a discrete film that forcing the limits of human conscious and brain.anybody who have seen the 'machinist ' would realize the similarities with breaking dawn.a man that could not escape from his conscience ( again a psychological and an abstract concept ) meets it in an human body.and he will just be free of accepting and realizing there is no way of escape.also i want to mention about the performances of 'breking dawn 's stuffs.in spite of having not many experiences , from actors and actresses to director all exhibited separately reasonable performance that have created a synergy which would increase the quality of the movie
