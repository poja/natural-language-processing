if you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war , you need to see `` letyat zhuravli '' ( called `` the cranes are flying '' in english ) .
it tells the story of veronika ( tatiana samoylova ) and boris ( aleksey batalov ) , who are in love on the verge of wwii .
they are walking along the waterfront , watching the cranes fly by , when the war starts .
boris is promptly sent off to war .
veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son , whom she does not love .
boris , meanwhile , continues trotting through the countryside , fighting the nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war , until he he runs out of energy .
when veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this news , she refuses to accept it , until boris ' body arrives home on one of the trains .
simultaneously , the radio announces that germany has surrendered and the allied powers have won the war ; the soviet union lost 27 million citizens , but it 's the start of a new era.this movie did a very good job showing the human impact of the war not only in the battlefield , but also how it affected the civilian population .
this is definitely a movie that everyone should see .
