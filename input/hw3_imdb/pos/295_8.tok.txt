you can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard ; that layer is hackneyed .
or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war ( stripped of `` judgement '' ) ; that layer is completely uninteresting.or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of duvall 's one-liners , but that 's just a coating for commercial mastication.you can try to view this as a 'realistic ' vietnam war film , but ask any veteran and he 'll swat down that notion -- most vets will say it stinks.or view it as a 'will he or wo n't he ' morality play -- nothing rich there , either.where i found the value was in the superb self-reference .
coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions ( the war ) to fit the greatness of the skilled multi-dimensional actor playing 'a great man'.brando the man was as much of a maverick as the kurtz character .
the studios were uncomfortable with his acting 'method ' , yet he always excelled and won accolades ; the 'generals ' are uncomfortable with kurtz 's 'unsound methods ' , in spite of his strategic genius.so coppola makes a movie all about brando 's greatness .
to hammer on the point , he places himself in the movie ( as hopper , a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras ) to spout his praises .
brando himself is only seen in half-light and silhouettes -- brilliant cinematography by storaro that only increases the actor 's power .
and he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation .
oh , yes : `` the horror ... '' other pieces of interest : the great use of point of view camera perspectives , including 'being in the firefight ' long before `` private ryan '' ; the ground breaking use of sound , notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip.do n't get caught in the outer layers ; the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound , vision and self-reference .
