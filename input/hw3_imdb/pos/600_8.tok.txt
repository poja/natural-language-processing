i would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released .
all these years later at 37 and i had no qualms hiring it on dvd .
great entertainment for all ages .
and what about the song the rainbow connection ?
see : why are there so many songs about rainbows and what 's on the other side ?
rainbows are visions , but only illusions , and rainbows have nothing to hide .
so we 've been told and some choose to believe it i know they 're wrong , wait and see .
someday we 'll find it , the rainbow connection , the lovers , the dreamers and me.who said that every wish would be heard and answered when wished on the morning star ?
somebody thought of that , and someone believed it , and look what it 's done so far .
what 's so amazing that keeps us stargazing and what do we think we might see ?
someday we 'll find it , the rainbow connection , the lovers , the dreamers , and me.all of us under its spell , we know that it 's probably magic ... ... have you been half asleep ?
and have you heard voices ?
i 've heard them calling my name .
... is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors ?
the voice might be one and the same i 've heard it too many times to ignore it it 's something that i 'm s'posed to be ... someday we 'll find it , the rainbow connection , the lovers , the dreamers , and me.laa , da daa dee da daa daa , la laa la la laa dee daa doo ...
