`` blind date '' is one of three stories-made-into-movie by author vida hurst .
lots of familiar faces in this oldie from 1934. mickey rooney as a mouthy little punk .
he seems to be in the film for comedic and homey `` family values '' .
jane darwell again plays the strong-willed mother , just as she had in grapes of wrath and the oxbow incident .
ann sothern is kitty , who has been dating bill ( paul kelly ) , but meets up with rich bob hartwell , played by neil hamilton , who may or may not be better for her .
you can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the hays production code -- at one point , kitty says she ca n't be up there alone with him if there is n't anyone else in the house ... what a change from just a year or two prior , when anything and everything was ok. good solid plot , but a whole lot of conversation and mushy love talk .
it raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man ; should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice , or just find a man with big bucks , as most of the movies from the previous 20 years had advocated ... ?
and how do men change when their situation changes ?
watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene .
tv viewers from the 1960s will recognize hamilton as commissioner gordon from batman ... .. also some weird drama in the off-screen lives for some of the cast in this one -- paul kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle .
mickey rooney had an affair with norma shearer , who was 20 years older ; rooney ended up being married eight times .
tyler brooke ( emory ) and spencer charters ( pa ) both knocked themselves off in real life .
the title `` blind date '' has been reused many times , for films , tv series , and even cartoons , but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one .
