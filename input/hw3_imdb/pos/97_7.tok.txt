well , i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short .
he loves it and claimed it was hilarious .
i enjoyed it but did n't see any humor .
he does n't even like hockey or know anything about it , and still loved the story .
living right across the border from canada , i have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in buffalo ... .but i did n't think much of this cartoon .
oh , it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area - disaster !
that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians .
however , that does n't make the story funny .
back in the 1950s , everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player , maurice richard , and everyone wanted to be like him .
when his mother orders a new sweater , it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it , so the kid does n't want to be caught dead wearing it.. when he finally does and heads to the local rink , he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies .
what 's so funny about that ?
i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox die-hard and his mom gets him yankees shirt !
horrors !
you could n't wear it , and vice-versa.maybe to someone who does n't follow sports at all , like maltin , this situation seems odd and humorous to him ... but it 's a fact of life or any bit-time sports fan and his favorite team .
it was an interesting story , and totally believable , but nothing that made me laugh.the art was fun to look at throughout , almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid .
the french canadian accent was good , too .
this movie was part of the dvd `` leonard maltin 's animation favorites from the national film board of canada .
