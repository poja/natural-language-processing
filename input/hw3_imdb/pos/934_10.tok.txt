this film is not only the last piece of the three colours trilogy , but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s .
there 's hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being .
valentine ( irene jacob ) lives in geneva , where she works as a model .
though she has a boyfriend , she seems to be rather lonely .
one night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to his owner , a retired jugde ( jean-louis trintignant ) , who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls .
disgusted by him she can not go away and they meet again .
two lonely souls meet each other and they become friends and develop a deep love for each other .
the story itself is too complex to be told completely , there is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and valentines real love and there is more to their relationship than only friendship.the actors are wonderful , irene jacob and jean-louis trintignant developing a deep and authentic friendship .
the topics are of an endless validity , fraternity , not only in contact with each other , but also in the respect for the right of privacy .
alarmingly we seem to loose this right more and more , which makes movies like this one even more important than it might have been in 1994.red is one of the strongest colours that exists , representing inner turmoil , love , anger and passion .
used here as another protagonist , it brings a unmatched depth to the movie .
a masterpiece !
