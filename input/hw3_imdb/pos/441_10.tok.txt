`` french cancan '' is one of my favorite all time movies .
it 's an excellent film .
there 's color , there 's humor , there 's music .
it 's a very good portrait of the so called belle Ã©poque , though jean renoir 's priorities were always to show a creation , a fantasie .
so the film is n't a historical movie .
the final sequences in which the girls dance cancan are unforgettable images .
it 's a film you should n't miss .
