red skelton ( in his first starring role ) plays wally benton who plays 'the fox ' on a radio show .
he writes the murder mysteries and as 'the fox ' solves them .
joseph jones ( conrad veidt ) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone .
he kidnaps benton , his girlfriend ( ann rutherford ) and another girlfriend ( virginia grey ) .
he tells benton to write out the perfect murder ... or his girlfriends get it ... very funny and enjoyable movie .
fast-moving ( it 's only 77 minutes ) , a good script and perfect casting really puts this across .
skelton is very good in his first starring role -- very funny , fast , handsome and intelligent .
veidt is excellent as the evil jones .
rutherford and grey are lots of fun as skelton 's girlfriends .
all three of them play off each other perfectly -- their verbal sparring is the highlight of this pic .
also fun to see eve arden in a small role.well worth your time .
