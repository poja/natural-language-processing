good film.i managed to pick this up on dvd in a local store sale .
Â£2.99 seems like a good deal and it is .
thing is the film is named `` to kill for '' .
it took a little detective work to find out it 's original name.in the uk it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the `` ability to sell '' .
having seen final destination 3 last night it , in my view , should have been a 18.maybe the fact the delightful , traci lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18. such a shame.traci is a great actress and should be given the chance to appear in bigger and large budget productions .
she ability to turn what is branded a b-movies into a fine performance is nothing short of amazing.long live traci lords and her incredible talent as an actress .
