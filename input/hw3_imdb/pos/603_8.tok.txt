y'know , it 's very interesting watching this ... half the people involved with it are now dead ... anyways , it 's been a long time since i 've watched anything muppet related , but this stuff is pure gold .
i 'm a great fan of puns , and this movie has them quite well placed , but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing : it 's not really high-speed children 's pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character 's depth , it 's just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go.kermit the frog is just an awesome character .
his voice and the expressions on his puppet-face are fantastic .
but above all , he points out why he 's popular -- '' he can sing and make jokes too ! ''
-- but more appropriately why he 's so endearing -- he , without any effort , inspires everyone to search for their dreams .
in the meantime , he also has to deal with himself , which is an uncommon theme in family movies.it also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there , some to great effect , others to a little less ( i think mel brook 's part was just a bit overplayed , do you ? )
.
some parts of the film are just kind of odd .
but it 's highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination from a very different direction.moving right along ... -- polarisdib
