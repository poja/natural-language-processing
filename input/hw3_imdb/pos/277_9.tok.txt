so real and surreal , all in one .
i remember feeling like tessa .
heck , i remember being tessa .
this was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending .
i especially liked the protesters tangent .
it is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it .
if you get the chance to see this , take it .
it is well worth the 30 minutes .
