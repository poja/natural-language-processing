i am sick of series with young and clueless people , talking about their `` problems '' all the time , self centered , boring and absolutely annoying ( popular ; dawson 's creek ; beverly hills ; etc ) .
`` hack '' is a breath of fresh air , with a great actor ( david morse ) , a completely different plot , credible people with real problems ( thank god !
! )
and very , very good histories .
i just love it !
!
i hope `` hack '' will go on for a long time , because it is a great television series for grown up people , for a change .
