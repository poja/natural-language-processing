this movie is a must see for any war movie buff .
one of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such as : kilgore : if i say its safe to surf this beach captain , then its safe to surf this beach !
kilgore : smell that ?
you smell that ?
lance : what ?
kilgore : napalm , son .
nothing in the world smells like that .
kilgore : i love the smell of napalm in the morning .
you know , one time we had a hill bombed , for 12 hours .
when it was all over , i walked up .
we did n't find one of 'em , not one stinkin ' dink body .
the smell , you know that gasoline smell , the whole hill .
smelled like ... victory .
someday this war 's gon na end ...
