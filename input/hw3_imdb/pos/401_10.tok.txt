the sort of `` little '' film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore .
sort of a `` soul '' version of the more well-known `` the last of the blonde bombshells '' .
ian mcshane is excellent as a dj and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re-uniting the members of a classic soul group , and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members ; a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as isaac hayes , as well as acting stalwarts taurean blacque , derrick o'connor and antonio fargas .
not meant to be an epic by any means , this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold .
