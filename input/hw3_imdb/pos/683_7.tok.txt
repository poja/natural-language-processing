i first saw this as a kid ( the little rascals first went on tv the year i was born ) and fairly recently bought this on dvd .
in between , i watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1 ) the pie fight itself and 2 ) how racist some of these parts were : farina as a nubian slave , doing voodoo , for example .
i think roach and mcgowan would have been beaten to death if they 'd tried to do that now.notice how the pie fights in the three stooges ' halfwits ' holiday and in the sweet pie and pie resemble this one ... and this film came out a few years before their initial contract with harry cohn at columbia pictures .
there was obviously some inspiration from ss and laurel & hardy 's the battle of the century for these films ... remember , at that time , they all stole from the best , each other !

one more note : laurel & hardy buffs , that bake sale lady was none other than dorothy coburn , who also appeared in tbotc-the 'flapper ' getting into her car and getting it in the rear end .
it always escapes me why she was never credited ?
