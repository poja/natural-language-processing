i enjoyed the muppet movie very much .
it was the first of the muppet movies and is by far the best because it 's so creative and fresh .
with later films , the ideas just did n't seem quite so original .
but here , we get to see kermit and miss piggy riding bikes ( an incredibly difficult scene ) , an excellent ensemble cast and just a lot of fun .
i loved every minute the muppets were performing and i would have rated the film a lot higher except for one serious problem .
in this and most subsequent muppet films , some powers that be felt there was a need to include lots of non-muppets -- in particular , many , many cameos by stars .
some worked fine ( such as charles durning 's ) but many just seemed irrelevant and slowed the picture to a grinding halt .
probably the worst of them was with edgar bergan .
yes , he was an amazing man who inspired jim henson and the rest of his crew , but the tiny scene he 's in just was n't needed nor were most of the cameos .
still , despite this big complaint , it 's a great film for the entire family -- from the kids to even the most demanding adults .
