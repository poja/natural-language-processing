well , i 'm an italian horror big fan and i love movies from directors such argento , fulci , bava sr and bava jr , only to quote the most famous .
`` la villa delle anime maledette '' is one of the most unknown movie of this genre , shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today , and director carlo ausino sounds totally new to my ears ( althoug he directed six movies ... this is the price italian directors have to pay to not work in rome ... ) .
but the film is not so bad .
and it 's absolutely not correct to talk about `` trash '' .
ok , the plot is not so original ; it reminds me stuff like the amytville series ( the year is the same of `` amityville possession '' by damiano damiani ) or `` shock '' , the last work of mario bava .
but you have to think that this is the movie of a cinematographer ( like mario bava movies ) ; so the most important thing is the atmosphere , not the story or the characters ; atmosphere very well created by the use of light and by the camera movement .
the rest remain in the background .
i think the movie works ; not so good , but works ; it 's surely better than a lot of hollywoodian production like `` the haunting '' which have a bigger budget , but not bigger ideas ...
