after finishing the zero woman series , i was looking forward to the female prisoner scorpion series ; both based upon comics by tooru shinohara .
unfortunately , i was not able to see them in order , as this is the third in the series.it starts great as the scorpion ( meiko kaji ) is escaping from the police .
detective kondo ( mikio narita ) did manage to get a cuff on her , but she proceeded to cut off his arm and get away .
if that is n't bad enough , later on a dog digs up the arm and is seen trotting down the street before finding a place to enjoy his treat.scorpion might as well go back to prison as life is no picnic on the outside .
first , a local yakuza tanida ( v ) threatens to put her back if she does n't put out ; and then the gang leader gets her when she gets rid of tanida .
but , they do n't hold her for long before she escapes and is looking for vengeance.soon they are dropping like flies .
some certainly deserved it for wearing garish outfits with shirt collars so big they went all the way to the shoulder .
the madam ( reisen lee ) turns herself in to avoid getting killed.the police arrive at her latest kill and trap her in the sewer .
she 's in there for a week and the cops find out that a friend ( yayoi watanabe ) has been supplying her with food .
( the story o yuki ( watanabe ) and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting , but only incidental to the movie . )
they try to burn her out , but this is the scorpion , and she has some unfinished business.not the usual mix of sex and violence , this is a slow tale that is beautiful throughout .
