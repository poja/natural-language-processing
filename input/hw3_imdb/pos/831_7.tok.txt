this is the best direct-to-dvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet .
van damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states .
the action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with van damme 's best .
costar scott adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre .
for further evidence check out `` undisputed 2 '' .
adkins is so good in fact that before i watched `` the shepherd '' , i thought that van damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen .
van damme holds his own though and although he is n't quite as athletic as adkins is , he can still kick with the best of them .
all of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well .
the only negative thing i can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped .
i think van damme 's character 's motives should have been presented earlier in the movie , especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit .
the reason he does is very cool but you do n't find out until the very end .
there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a van damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it ai n't character development .
overall though , this is a solid action movie that i recommend .
so run for the damme border !
