i thought anywhere but here was a good movie.it stars two wonderful actresses , susan sarandon and natlie portman , which when i heard they were in a movie together i resist watching it.overall , it was a pretty enjoyable movie.it had it 's moments where i felt as if they tried to hard , and there was also some really overdone and worn-out material , but there was n't anything in the movie that i absolutely hated.i even liked how they used the pop-up performance of the uncredited thora birch , and all the little happy/sad moments are touching and effective.if you want to watch this movie , go ahead , because even though i do n't recommend it , it 's not something you should avoid , and a 5.9 rating seems unfair in my opinion .
