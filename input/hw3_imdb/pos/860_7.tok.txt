i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date , this year , it is one of my favorites .
the story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and i knew what would happen far too early .
usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me ( like `` the others '' ) but even knowing the outcome i still enjoyed it right up to the end .
looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from kelly overton ( eve ) , i 'm afraid i was not .
her performance seemed to be the weak part of the film to me , in contrast to the amazing performance ( or characterization ) by james haven ( don wake ) ... i hope we see more of him .
what a great little film , highly recommended to all !
