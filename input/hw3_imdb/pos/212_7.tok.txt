nothing like this was seen on tv at that time and probably never will again .
from the first image of that police light blinding you and from there you heard the words : `` police squad - in color '' , you were schocked to see that this in no way was an ordinary sitcom.also to kill off a `` guest star '' and then never refer to him again , where had you ever seen that before .
then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention , you would miss several jokes in the background .
do n't pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry .
this was the show that video recorders were made for , way before married with children or the simpsons.the stories did in no way make sense and the dialog was sometimes so weird that you had to think about it for 5 minutes before realising that it was a joke.the characters frank drebin and ed hocken came right out of dragnet and they were absolutely straight ( no funny accents or expressions ) but instead there were puns and twisted sentences played absolutely deadpan .
only once as i can remember , were there a segment played for silly laughs - a scene involving a trip to a dentist , suction and a whole lot of saliva.there were some tedious moments - like the informer johnny and an appearance by some celebrity .
that was strictly a one-joke moment but they had to use it in all six episodes .
oh , well .
everything ca n't be perfect .
the important thing is that the rest of the time you were knee deep in tears of laughter.leslie nielsen was fortunate that this revived his career when they put the frank drebin character in 3 features but it must have been an achilles heel as well .
can you remember seeing him in anything except naked gun type work since ?
and do n't count the awful mr. magoo reworked for live action .
he probably made a lot of money , though .
