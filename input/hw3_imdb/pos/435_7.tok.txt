this was a pleasant musical about the creation of the moulin rouge dance hall .
in many ways , this reminds me of the hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s , in that it has many clich√©s leading up to the inevitable conclusion ( `` will the show still go on ? ''
) .
while of course none of this is new , it was enjoyable and well made .
the musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch .
in many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of the great ziegfeld .
in real life , ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the american film .
but , in french cancan , the characters have fully functioning libidos -- but nothing is really shown , so the movie is okay for kids.nothing new but well done nevertheless .
