transcendental , sophisticated , incisive , emotive , powerful ... i could think of a hundred adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence , and still i would feel they were insufficient .
all i can really say is that i am infatuated with this film .
applause to krzysztof kieslowski , zbigniew preisner , ir√®ne jacob , and jean-louis trintignant .
may `` rouge '' live forever .
