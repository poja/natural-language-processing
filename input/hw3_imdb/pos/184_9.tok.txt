i watched this movie on tcm last night , all excited expectation , having last seen it ( twice ) in its memorable 1957 release in toronto .
i told my wife , who had n't seen it before , to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot , no cuts , where veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her boris .
in a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern steadicam , the shot then pulls back up and cranes ( pun unintended ) over the street as she exits the bus , and darts among the tanks to cross the road .
then i remember that , no cuts , we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through , anxiously looking for him , but does not find him .
but we do continue to follow veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women , all extras , and each one a gem of riveting stanislavskian behavior .
how , one wonders , did kalatozov and his cameraman urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence .
but what did i see in this version ?
after crossing the street dodging the tanks , the scene abruptly ended , and cut back to scenes at the apartment , before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence .
seems to me that this film was not only restored , but also re-edited .
what a downer !
