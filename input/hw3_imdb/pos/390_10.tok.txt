cam archer 's lyrical bobbycrush boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is adolescent desire with a lush rendering ( beautifully photographed by aaron platt ) that is more vibe than narrative .
caught somewhere between documentary and dream , bobbycrush recalls the inventiveness of early todd haynes and the vivid hyperrealism of gus van sant .
with grit , glamour and heartbreak , it 's kinda like the movie equivalent of sonic youth playing bubblegum pop .
