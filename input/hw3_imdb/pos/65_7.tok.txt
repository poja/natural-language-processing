i am an avid julie andrews fan and i just watched this for the first time on dvd -- the director 's cut version .
i was very surprised that it was rated g. how did they get bedroom scenes , a seduction story line , two strip tease acts , and war/shooting/blood into a g rating ?
weird .
i would rate it pg-13.other than that i thoroughly enjoyed the movie .
it was a beautiful showcase of andrew 's voice and talent .
the acting was great .
the storyline was a little weak , leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue .
there were too many `` no talking , just walking '' scenes for me ... i would have liked to see the the relationship between julie and rock blossom , so that the intense love would be more believable .
