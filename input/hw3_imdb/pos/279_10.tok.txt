in moments of desperation were willing to do whatever it takes to win .
i loved how the maple leaves futility was used as a metaphorical basis for bobby and tessa .
the acting was accurate by far superior from the hogwash intake given by the film industry.great editing !
at the end of the short i felt it was a bit incomplete but so is life and this is were life and art waltz into cinematic masterpiece.excuse me while i rinse off the cheese whiz , but i guess it 's acceptable at certain times.two scenes which i must point out are : the bath tub and the couch scene.the couch scene for tessa was a defining moment and 360 of the human condition .
throughout the short i viewed her as a brute , but now we see her true reality .
her mind spoke before her heart .
need i say more about the bath tub scene .
