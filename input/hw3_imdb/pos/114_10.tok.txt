i admire deepa mehta and this movie is a masterpiece .
i 'd recommend to buy this movie on dvd because it 's a movie you might want to watch more often than just once .
and trust me , you 'd still find little meaningful details after watching it several times.the characters - except for the grandmother perhaps - are all very balanced , no black and white .
even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists , there is also empathy for the other characters.i think the imdb rating for the movie is far too low - probably due to its politically controversial content .
