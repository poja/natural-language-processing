i was able to see `` anywhere but here '' last night as a free sneak preview .
i absolutely loved the film !
i was drawn to it because of the realistic portrayal of a mother/daughter relationship ... there was definitely a connection between adele a and ann .
i think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both susan sarandon and natalie portman .
sarandon was just the right actress to portray adele and after leaving the theater i could not think of another actress in the role .
portman was also excellent as ann .
she brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that i do n't think any other teenage actress could .
i think it would the academy of motion picture arts and sciences should give credit where it is due and nominate both sarandon and portman for awards in the `` actress '' and `` supporting actress '' categories .
it would be a shame if they were overlooked .
