beware my lovely originated from a play written by mel dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women .
his first and best effort was the screenplay for the spiral staircase .
he also did a loretta young suspense thriller cause for alarm a couple of years earlier .
the play dinelli wrote was originally entitled the man and it ran for 92 performances on broadway during the 1950 season .
it was dinelli 's only effort on broadway and it starred dorothy gish and richard boone .
the roles that gish and boone played are taken by ida lupino and robert ryan .
for whatever reason rko thought to eliminate the age difference .
dinelli himself rewrote his play for the screen so i 'm wondering what he thought about that .
certainly the frailty issue was eliminated completely from the story.that was n't the only thing that was eliminated .
the people are all wearing period clothing from around world war i yet there 's no reference at all to the time this story takes place in .
i thought that strange and later on when the telephone company repairman comes to ida lupino 's residence , i noticed his truck was a vintage one of the same era.the film is almost entirely set within ida lupino 's home where she 's hired an itinerant stranger in robert ryan as a handyman .
the film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference .
it turns out that ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons lupino in her home for about a day.both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made .
films like beware my lovely are the stuff that a small studio like rko did best .
if this were done at mgm or paramount the glossy trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story .
