if you enjoy riddles and suspense , you will enjoy this movie .
truth be told it was mostly the adrian paul part that got me to pick it up , i knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand .
plot is : sarah ( carly pope ) , a student of philosophy and metaphysics , starts playing a mysterious riddle game trying to figure out `` the reason '' and gets involved in `` the game '' by solving riddles .
vern ( adrian paul ) is a shop owner , also a riddle fanatic , and also gets entangled in the game .
myth has it that if you solve the game , the meaning of existence ( referred to as `` the design '' ) is revealed .
brendan fehr 's character is a `` village idiot '' type hanging around the shop who turns out to be more than he seems .
all in all , i thought the movie was pretty well done .
and it 's definitely an original concept , a rare find these days !
i personally happen to like riddles and puns , so while most of them were n't very difficult , it was still a fun movie .
well worth the rental .
so , if you have n't seen it -- get it !
