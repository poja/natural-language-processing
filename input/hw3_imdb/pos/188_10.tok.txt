sick of the current cinema output , particularly american cinema , i 've been making an effort to see the oscar-winning foreign films .
that 's when i came across this gem .
slow to start , it picks up nicely once war is declared .
basically an old fashioned girl-waits-for-boy-to-return-from-war-story , the performances , the cinematography make this so very much more .
why tatyana samojlova as the young woman did n't become an international star after this is beyond me ( though she has remained successful in her own country ) .
you take the journey with her : young , defiant impetuous young girl , who , through the ravages of war becomes a very sober , somber woman who keeps a glimmer of hope ( her final scene is devastating ) .
we love her as much as the camera does .
and the camera-work !
was this the pioneer in hand-held camera work ?
it truly adds an immediacy to the story .
and the beauty of it ( like when tatyana 's character is running up stairs and next to a slatted fence ) .
i am humbled and grateful to see this film .
