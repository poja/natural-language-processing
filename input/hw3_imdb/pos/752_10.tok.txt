this is such a fun and funny movie .
highly entertaining at all angles .
it features an outlandish array of memorable , psychotic but lovable nuts .
we got ; the judge , the sargent , the kid , the creepy old lady , the slut , the clown .
and unfortunately they all live in a big house that does n't have any locks and is understaffed .
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around , play games , and be dangerous .
we also learn a lesson along the way ... never give your patient an ax !
this was before cukkos nest , and surpasses it .
at least on the fun level .
it even has its sweet moments .
`` love is pure .
love is grace .
love is strength .
you love me , your love is pure , you 'll always love me . ''
now who could resist that ?
nuts are humans too .
just a few loose wires .
be a little careful , or you 'll get an ax in the back !
children at play .
hehe.the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine .
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played .
and i really did find them funny .
no , hilarious !
they may even give you dirty thoughts of how you can take advantage of them .
or how they can take advantage of you.this is actually a very smart movie .
there is a brilliant twist ending .
i must say i expected this to be a good but never expected this .
it is horrific .
`` the court has made its decision .
you are no longer in control ! ''
i love it .
the ending is so , so perfect ... you 'll shed a tear.i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this .
i will never forget it now .
it is not just a cult ... it is a cult classic .
whatever you do ... do n't look in the basement !
