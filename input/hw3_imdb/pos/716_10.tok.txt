i watch a lot of movies - dvd , features , and classics , you name it .
the night i watched jericho mile , my wife ( who had ordered it on the internet ) said she remembered it from when she was in high school , that it had stayed with her all of these years .
somewhat reluctantly i sat down ( with our daughter & son ) , and was riveted from the opening sequence to the end titles .
we all were .
she , who remembered the original , and our kids ( 18 and 16 ) who had no idea what the movie was about could n't believe it .
our favorite scene ?
bar none , when peter strauss so passionately bangs his fist down and says , `` i 'd do it again ! ''
.
it did n't advocate violence because it was a defense crime , but evoked such intensity we could n't believe it ... when his fellow cell mates gave him their food in support of his efforts , there was n't a dry eye in our house.someone please make more movies like this one .
unbelievable !
