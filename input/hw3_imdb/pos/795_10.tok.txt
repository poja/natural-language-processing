along with cops , the goat is one of keaton 's two funniest shorts .
which makes it one of the best shorts ever made .
this has an decent `` plot '' for a short , and it forms a perfect line on which to hang some great gags .
keaton is mistaken for an escaped convict ( how the mistake happens is a classic ) and then must elude the authorities .
best gags - the bread line and t he `` elevator '' .
