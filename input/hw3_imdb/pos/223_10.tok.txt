two years after 'airplane ! '
took off , jim abrahams , jerry and david zucker cast one of its stars - leslie nielsen - in this hilarious television series , a glorious take-off of old u.s. detective shows such as 'dragnet ' .
nielsen played frank drebin , america 's answer to 'inspector clouseau ' .
it had the same style of humour as 'airplane ! '
; clever visual gags in the background , unnoticed absurdities , and recurring characters such as johnny the shoe-shine boy who seems to know everything about everything .
guest-stars ( including william shatner ! )
were killed off in the opening credits .
'police squad ' was the first u.s. sitcom since 'batman ' to lack a laugh track .
many have lamented the fact that only six episodes were made , but i think it was about right .
the concept could never have sustained a full 24-episode run .
five years later , 'police squad ' made a successful transfer to the big screen , when the first of the 'naked gun ' trilogy was released .
jim , jerry , david , and leslie had the last laugh .
