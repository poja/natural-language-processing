beautiful ... .that one word pretty much sums up this whole film .
everything from the cinematography , the directing , the acting ... ..brilliant .
at any point of the film , you can pause it , and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or `` artsy fartsy '' as some people would say .
i assure you , that after one viewing , `` bobbycrush '' will be stuck in your head .
i know this from first hand experience .
even the soundtrack is great .
it goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film .
be thankful that cam archer exists in this world .
we need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real ( and surreal ) imagery .
