believe me i wanted this series to work , but the early departure of kevin kilner dealt a near death blow after season one .
robert leeshock just was n't right for the part and jane heitmeyer did an admirable job as lead but the series just got too messy and confused at that point .
i do n't know what happened in season five , what a mess .
sometimes its time to drop the red cape and just stick the sword in the bull , if you know what i mean .
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict .
if not for their talents and well-written dialogue they would have been two weird bald man-chicks in a b-movie series.if only this series could have ended at season 4 and picked up later by syfy ...
