a good story about rusty parker ( rita hayworth ) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with danny ( gene kelly ) and genius ( phil silvers ) .
rusty is in love with danny .
all three are good friends and every friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl ( they never eat them ) .
the story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing .
the movie has two questions that rusty must answer : is fame all that it is cracked up to be ?
and is less really more if you are happy ?
answering those questions makes the movie .
the movie also does a good job of showcasing the talents that all three principals had .
never a dull moment !
