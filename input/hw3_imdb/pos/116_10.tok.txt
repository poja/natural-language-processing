it is more a subtle story of the fact that in indian household how most decisions are taken by the man , how no attention is paid to the desires of the lady , for example how even when the husband and wife sleep together it would be a test for the husband whether he can control his desires , not to give the woman pleasure .
and in such a type of scenario , women invariably have two choices , either to accept all this and take it into their own life , which is usually the case or not accept this and try to mould things to satisfy themselves , which makes a movie !
fire is a brilliantly directed story of the second option , which women choose for themselves , no sacrifice , not to serve anybody else , rather a decision for their own good .
somehow the whole idea of justifying lesbianism did n't find an acceptance in the indian audience but if one looks the whole movie from an angle of self-expression , then the whole debate does n't even arise .
