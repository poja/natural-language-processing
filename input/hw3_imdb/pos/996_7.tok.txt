welsh poet dylan thomas excused from serving in active duty is doing his bit for the war effort producing bits of prose for some propaganda branch of government in whitehall.thomas is portrayed as a freethinker believing in free love married to a woman with an equally demanding artistic streak and likewise with a penchant for extramarital romance .
thomas writing and reciting his poetry in systematic domestic mayhem throughout becomes somewhat priggish towards the end , resting somewhat uncomfortably on his society connections and pulling rank on a war veteran , who had shot up his house , and who was incidentally married to the woman he had been having an affair with.the real story of this film is the love of two women , one ( keira knightley ) whose first love was thomas ( matthew rhys ) , the second ( sienna miller ) who is thomas 's wife .
at times it reminds of the singing detective , as in very good television with slightly sinister overtones laid on top of scenes of surreal camp absurdity .
