'do n't look in the basement ' is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that brownrigg is one of horrors real underground stars and imho is vastly overdue some proper recognition .
'do n't ' is his undisputed masterpiece .
this scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd , disjointed , claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on .
it succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty , just plain grubby , for brownrigg 's world is this mad , unwashed , scummy prison cell of rants , obsessions and all shades of mental illness .
and he uses his low budget palette to wrap his grot blanket around you like a bad memory .
there is just something so beautifully odd about the whole damn thing .
in a word , classic ... .
also , if you watch 'do n't ' first then you will have some idea of the insane psychodrama style that marks brownrigg 's other films .
in summary they really do n't come any more esoteric than this - well , actually they do , track down brownrigg 's 'keep my grave open ' .
mad genius .
accept no substitute .
