i watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed .
this can-can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre , like stanley donen and gene kelly musical , but in french way .
and a jean renoir nice tribute to his time , his friends , lovers , music and dances .
it is at same time a show business chronicle of that age , full of affection and french mood .
it is too a clear tribute to the impressionism ( people who likes impressionistic painters will like this picture ) .
it is particularly a tribute to toulouse-lautrec and , of course , to jean renoir father , pierre-auguste .
you will find hear a trustworthy and splendid colored recreation of some renoir master work .
excellent casting , scenery , sound-effects and music .
even it tell us about the creation of parisian moulin rouge , obviously it is a fiction story ( and not very original by the way , as it fall down in the very well know moral that the show must go on ) .
but the jean renoir production is great .
