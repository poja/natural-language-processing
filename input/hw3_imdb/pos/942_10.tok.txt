the australian public and the australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great aussie films around , or that they are all the same.well in this case this film is not a carbon copy of other australian films .
it is unique - it will make you laugh out-loud , it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourself.the casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none .
the script and the photography ( colour/light etc ) is wonderful .
but more important this is a great film .
i do n't want to talk about the plot as i think it is always best to see a film knowing as little about it as possible .
suffice to say this film will appeal to a wide range of audiences .
take your girlfriend , take your mum , take your friends - for a great evening out.10/10 !
