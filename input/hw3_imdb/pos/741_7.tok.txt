dr. stephens ( michael harvey ) , head of a seriously understaffed institute for the insane , takes a 'progressive ' approach towards the treatment of his patients , even allowing his loonies complete freedom of the building , day and night ; he pays the price for his forward thinking , however , when he rather stupidly prescribes chopping wood with an axe as therapy for one of his patients and consequently gets his neck mistaken for a log ( serves him right for not suggesting basket weaving ) .shortly after this tragic incident , nurse charlotte beale ( rosie holotik ) arrives at the hospital to take up position as the doctor 's assistant , and discovers that the facility is now being run by the much sterner dr. geraldine masters ( annabelle weenick ) .
despite being unaware of her deceased predecessor 's decision to employ ms beale , and not particularly eager to take on new staff , dr. masters agrees to let the pretty nurse begin work , but following several harrowing experiences at the hospital , charlotte begins to wonder whether it might have been better if she had been turned away.it does n't take a genius to figure out what is actually happening at the hospital , the 'lunatics have taken over the asylum ' schtick being a premise that should be familiar to most seasoned horror fans , but s.f .
brownrigg 's do n't look in the basement still proves to be an entertaining piece of drive-in fun thanks to its well defined collection of nutters : lobotomised , popsicle-sucking sam ( bill mcghee ) ; judge oliver w. cameron ( gene ross ) , who continuously mumbles courtroom phrases ; old mrs. callingham ( rhea macadams ) , who recites william allingham 's creepy poem the fairies and warns charlotte of impending doom ; cackling loon danny ( jessie kirby ) , who delights in teasing the other patients ; harriet ( camilla carr ) , who thinks her doll is a real baby ; army nut sergeant jaffee ( hugh feagin ) ; and best of all , allyson king ( betty chandler ) , whose rejection by a series of men has left her with a craving for love ( ie.
, she tries to jump any man who goes near her ) .this convincingly crazy set of characters , plus a bit of gore and nudity , reasonable direction from brownrigg ( who also gave us the impressive white trash horror scum of the earth ) , and a solid turn from playboy covergirl holotik , all go to turn an otherwise rather predictable , low budget piece of exploitation into a very watchable psycho shocker .
