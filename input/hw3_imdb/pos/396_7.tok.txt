this is another good western , which i enjoyed.it 's not an epic or anything , but it is good for what it is.it ' about 3 fur trappers , led by a men named jed , who is crude and uncivilized.jed and his two friends find themselves as scouts for a fort that is the only thing standing between them and and indian band , who resent the americans on their land , and want to take it back.that 's the gist of the story.what follows is action , excitement , even a bit of humour , and forbidden romance.one of jed 's friends , gus , reminded me a lot of the character quint ( played by robert shaw ) in the movie jaws.they both have that crusty , gruff demeanor.anyway , if you 're a western fan , you should find lots to like about this particular entry.i think it deserves a 7/10
