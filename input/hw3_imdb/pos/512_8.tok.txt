wesley snipes is perfectly cast as blade , a half human , half vampire known the daywalker .
he has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood .
since he teamed up with whistler ( kris kristofferson ) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries , but omnipotent overlord deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) is tired of living in harmony with the humans ( food as he calls them ) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world.this movie is well cast , written and directed ; ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish .
packed with great fight sequences and slick dialogue , blade is certainly more action than horror , but it definitely delivers.8/10
