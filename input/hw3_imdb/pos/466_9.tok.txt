this really is a movie that you need to see twice .
when i first saw this film i was really drawn into the story .
while the majority of the story takes place inside of a hotel room , the stories that buddy ( nick drake , wonderful allusion ) and daphne share take you outside of their room and into their world .
through their conversations you get a feel for the loneliness and pain that each feels .
the soundtrack accompanies the movie perfectly , dark , lo-fi and intriguing .
when you see the film the second time around you can pick up all of the clues that you missed the first time around leading up to one of the best ending i have seen in a long time .
i hope to see this movie find a distributor for the dvd so that it will be more accessible .
great movie , you wo n't be disappointed .
