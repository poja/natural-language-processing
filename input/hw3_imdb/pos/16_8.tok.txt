i went to an advance screening of this movie thinking i was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines , mindless plot , and the kind of nauseous acting that made `` the postman '' one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time .
but i was shocked .
shocked to find a film starring costner that appealed to the soul of the audience .
shocked that ashton kutcher could act in such a serious role .
shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions .
not since 'robin hood ' have i seen this costner : full of depth and complex emotion .
kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting he played with in `` butterfly effect '' .
these two actors came into this film with a serious , focused attitude that shone through in what i thought was one of the best films i 've seen this year .
no , its not an oscar worthy movie .
it 's not an epic , or a profound social commentary film .
rather , its a story about a simple topic , illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible .
that 's what i think good film-making is and i for one am throughly impressed by this work .
bravo !
