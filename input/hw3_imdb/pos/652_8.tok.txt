a notorious big budget flop when released .
this robert altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast .
although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely , there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end .
if you are a fan of character actors and actresses , this will be a treat for you ; you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie ( you may not know their names , but you know their faces ) , heck even the kid from a christmas story turns up in a small part .
rent if from netflix , if you read this , i bet you will enjoy it .
