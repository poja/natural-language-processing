i am having a holiday in hong kong now , and i just saw gen y cops at the cinema ... .
what can i say ... it was sooo cool !
!
everything you could wish for was in it !
basically ... just see it if ya can ... i 'm gon na get my friend to send me the vcd when it comes out ... .only bad thing was the dodgy american style of talking employed by some of the hl actors ... like edison ... `` what 's up my man ?
! ''
but it did add even more humour to iy ... hhehesee it ... especially if ya like any of the following geners : hkfilm , action , comedy , sci fi !
seeitman !
!
edison did a good song for it too ... so download it ... edison tse - heroes
