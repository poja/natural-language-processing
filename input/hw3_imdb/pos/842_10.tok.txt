the third film in a cycle of incomparably brilliant exploitation movies , and the third masterpiece in a row , `` joshuu sasori : kemono-beya '' aka .
`` female prisoner scorpion : beast stable '' ( aka .
`` sasori : den of the beast '' where i live ) of 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some aspects , but that equals ( or arguably even surpasses ) them in brilliance .
the entire original sasori series with the wonderful meiko kaji stands out as the absolute highlight in wip cinema , and all of the films , especially the first three , uniquely combine exploitation and art-house cinema like no other movie does .
`` beast stable '' is the third , and second-to-last `` sasori '' film with meiko kaji , the last one to be directed by genius director shunya ito and , in my opinion , the greatest of them all .
the first film `` joshuu 701-gô : sasori '' of 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of exploitation cinema and simply the definition of exploitation-art .
in the equally brilliant first sequel , `` joshuu sasori : dai-41 zakkyo-bô '' ito added more surrealism and symbolism .
the third `` sasori '' film , `` beast stable '' keeps up the surrealism ( allthough not quite to the same extent as the second ) , and features even more social criticism than its predecessors .
topics like poverty , forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central themes of the movie .
this third `` sasori '' film is ingenious and sublime in all aspects and arguably the greatest of the , generally brilliant , cycle ( to me it 's this one , with the first one as a close second ) .
once again , `` best stable '' is both very artistic and very exploitation-like .
the visually stunning film features an enormous amount of brutal violence and sleaze again , as well as sequences of enormous surrealistic beauty .
the stunningly beautiful meiko kaji is once again brilliant in her role of nami matsushima ( aka .
sasori ) .
i absolutely worship this wonderful actress , and i 'm sure i 'm not the only one to do so .
the rest of the performances are also great , especially mikio narita is great as a police inspector who is obsessed with catching sasori .
the musical score is the same throughout all three films , with `` urami-bushi '' , sung by meiko kaji herself , as the main theme , which is great , since the score is , simply put , pure perfection .
as its predecessors , `` beast stable '' is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of exploitation-art that no serious lover of film can afford to miss .
the entire sasori-cycle ranges high on my personal all-time favorite list .
`` beast stable '' is arguably the most brilliant masterpiece of them all !
