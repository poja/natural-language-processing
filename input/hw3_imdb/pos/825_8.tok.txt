after 10 years , it is finally save to say that our belgian action star is back again .
i personally found this one to be even better than wake of death , which makes it his best movie in ... 10 years !
!
okay , it is not like his highlight years as timecop , universal soldier , sudden death or even his best effort to date : hard target ( one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors john woo . )
the action is good , the story is exciting , the dialogue is quite funny , this one is better than expected.the bad guys are awesome like in hard target , and the fight scenes are `` old school '' .
real fans know what to expect .
i must say , i gave up on him , but van damme is finally back .
more please ... .
