this film has its detractors , and courtney 's fey dresser may offend some folks ( who , frankly , need a good smack upside the head ) -- but the film is top notch in every way : engaging , poignant , relevant .
finney , naturally , is larger than life .
courtney makes an ideal foil .
i thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads , and courtney 's character provides plenty of dark humor .
the period is well captured , the supporting cast well chosen .
this is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial .
i only wish it were out on dvd already ... ( *sigh* ) ...
