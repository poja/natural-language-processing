i throughly enjoyed this short , even as a toronto maple leafs fan .
director sheldon cohen and narrator roch carrier captured all of the boy 's emotions perfectly .
from the feelings he had for his hero , maurice `` rocket '' richard , to the excitement , anticipation and hope of getting a new montreal canadiens sweater soon , to the look of horror on his face when he got his sweater from his mother ; a toronto maple leafs sweater was priceless and the shame of having to wear this dreadful ( in his eyes ) blue and white toronto maple leafs sweater ; not the rouge , bleu and blanc of the montreal canadiens with richard 's number nine , like his old sweater .
and worst of all , his mum made him wear this maple leafs sweater out of the house .
you could envision and anticipate the ridicule he would get from his friends when he hit the ice wearing that sweater before he got there.i was laughing the whole time and this is one of the best animated shorts i 've seen .
