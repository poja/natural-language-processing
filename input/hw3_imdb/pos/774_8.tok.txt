loved this movie , what a hoot .
rupert and julie are great together with rupert being almost poker faced against julie 's animation , which worked well .
laura did a good job as the overbearing mother.julie of course is marvellous as usual .
while this movie will keep you laughing most of the time it also has a poignant side to it as it unravels the secrets in the lives of the main characters .
interesting that it was entitled driving lessons as this might lead you to believe this is the main feature of the movie which directly it is not though it certainly could be seen as `` ben '' finally being in the driving seat in his own life .
like most things that are funny in life there is always the sad side and there are some moving moments in this movie .
very enjoyable movie and well worth watching .
