ok , everybody agreed on what was the best season .
the first .
and killing off boone was a bad desicion .
also killing off others was bad .
blame the directors and writers for it .
bad boys .
but .
i still think this is the best scifi series ever !
sorry guys i ca n't help it !
i see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season .
still it 's easy to accept liam as the new main character , if you are over boone .
he is really ... mysterious .
the thing that shocked me most was when lilli was written out of the story and how .
that was something she did n't deserve !
and what do we get ?
some blonde chick called renee , with absolutely no character !
but these taelons stay mysterious , and you stay wondering about theyre true plans till the end .
true suspence .
the conversations between zo'or and da'an are sometimes brilliant.i understand that , when you jump in on an episode from the 3th,4th or 5th season , you may not understand this show .
but when you watch from the beginning , you just cant break loose !
the acting is great , the special fx are marvellous , the music is beautiful and the plot intriguing .
got ta see this , guys !
