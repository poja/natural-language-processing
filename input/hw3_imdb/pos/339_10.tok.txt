this movie was astonishing how good it was !
the plot is extraordinary , and the acting spectacular .
at first i thought this was n't going to be that great because of a summary , but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie , it struck me that i was dead wrong .
i literally cried about four or five times in this movie , and despite this , i must 've watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week !
no , the song scenes were not as awesome as they could 've been , but the plot is what really gets you .
american or asain , i would recommend this to anyone -- and i have now .
i guarantee that after seeing this one , you 'll get the best out of it , and its plot .
i hope you feel the same , and write a rave review too !
