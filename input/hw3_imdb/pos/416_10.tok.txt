`` ahh ... i did n't order no amazing hit show '' ... .. '' we 'll you got one '' hack is simply the greatest television show ever made .
a little bit of me died when i flicked on the t.v .
one friday night to catch a little hack and it was n't on .
the show dug deep into key social issues of our culture .
i found that at the end of any episode i watched ; i walked away having been both entertained and informed .
i am actually dumber now that hack is gone .
i no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate .
since hack has been gone i see them as eyesore 's and an unneeded strain on taxpayers .
so for the love of god we need to bring back hack !
