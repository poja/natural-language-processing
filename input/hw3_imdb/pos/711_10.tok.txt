peter strauss , by nature of appearing in mini-series and made-for-tv films , often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews - usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film , having channel-hopped into it half-way through .
well , i 've just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about the jericho mile - that should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film !

peter strauss won an emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much ... .
looking to be objective , i attempted to criticise this film .
instead , i found myself arguing down every one of my possible nit-picks .
this is what true , realistic film-making is about .
this is not your typical hollywood sensationalism , where everything is overacted - it 's so realistic and true to life that people have thought it 's based on a real event !
