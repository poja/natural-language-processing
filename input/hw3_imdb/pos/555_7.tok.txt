this film was a new direction for natalie portman .
a much more adult role , though she comes to it from the traces of a child in the movie itself .
ann , ( portman ) and susan sarandon , who plays her newly divorced mother , adele , travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to beverly hills .
there these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as portman 's character grows up .
unknowingly at first to adele , she grows up and becomes a better mother for it.ann sees her mother telling her she wants to be an actress , or so she thinks .
adele uses that crutch every time there are problems in their lives .
we see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms between themselves and with being alone , having left their old lives behind.the acting is top notch from both of them .
they seemingly become mother and daughter before your eyes .
you can almost feel there is a bond there beyond the actual movie.though this movie really does n't take us to any new ground in these types of films , the fact that the acting is well done , and the story is n't too flawed , let 's me recommend it.i will say however , it will probably go away soon , i do n't believe it can have the staying power needed for a huge christmas season of movies starting in a week or so .
see it now before this happens if you like either of these actresses .
