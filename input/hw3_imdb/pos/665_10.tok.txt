it 's the 1980 's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of murder mcgee .
after mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an ouija board , the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one .
sound familiar ?
it 's supposed to .
it 's clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80 's slashers with the tagline : `` excessive violence .
gratuitous nudity .
zero budget . ''
ca n't get enough ; it 's pure entertainment !
i enjoyed the humor and the way it poked fun at all the horror clich√© 's , but at the same time embraced what was fun about movies from this time .
there is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80 's slasher films though : good acting .
the entire cast was very talented and you do n't see that very much in any low budget flicks , recent or otherwise .
there was a lot of chemistry between the characters .
i was very entertained throughout the entire film , and i am fully convinced the writer/director and cast will go a long way in their separate careers .
the script was very well written , and the dialogue flowed naturally.the effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not lit well , but the fact that this movie admits on its cover there was practically no budget , i already know this going in .
this film makes it simple to politely ignore its faults and just sit back and enjoy .
although this is not an oscar award winning opus , it never claims to be , and props to that .
it 's a lot of fun .
if you like slashers , you 'll really appreciate this film .
if you like blood and boobies , you 'll appreciate it also .
