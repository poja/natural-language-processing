this seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing .
it may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the world war ii era , but i recommend that all others beware .
many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak .
the story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough , but there 's no real pacing or tension in the story .
i also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying , partially due to some strong english accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording .
i give this a 55/100 .
most folks will want to `` steer '' clear .
