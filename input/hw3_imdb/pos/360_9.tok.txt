i just re-watched this thriller , one i had previously believed to be one of hitch 's lesser efforts .
how wrong can you be !
maybe because i 'm older , or maybe because the film gets better with every viewing , but now i think it 's amazing .
every bit of suspense is wrung out of the tiniest detail , and that final scene on the merry-go-round is just breath-taking !
perfect in every way , highly recommended .
