i give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic .
also it is directed by legendary sasquatch hunter robert w morgan who also plays the part of jarvis in the film .
in listening to recent blogtalkradio show called the aarf show ( robert morgan is a co-host ) he tells that because it has become such a cult classic and does well at movie conventions and such , there are plans to maybe do a sequel to this film .
i think he said that two of the original stars have signed on and he hopes to have a few more .
robert is a good man and i hope it does well .
he has devoted 50+ years of tireless work as a sassquatch researcher ( which is also one of my interests ) and author .
check out his show on the paranormal and maybe look for blood stalkers ii sometime in the near future .
