the `` silver screen '' gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying life 's rainbows .
there 's plenty of silver hair on this silver screen , but the film 's namesake is more like 85-going on-25 with his energy , humor and lust for life .
the story of entertainer extraordinaire uncle frank , his devoted wife aunt tillie , and the zippy residents of the local area nursing homes inspires us to `` live each day as if it 's your last '' and brings a glimmer of hope to those often-dreaded golden years .
a great movie for young and old audiences !
