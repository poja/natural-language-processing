this metro film is episodic , but nearly a constant series of chases , mainly trying to escape police , whether real or imagined , as buster is mistaken for an escaped criminal .
it is consistently inventive and entertaining .
its greatest value is in its documenting what hollywood looked like in the early twenties , since 95 % of it is shot outside among the streets and building exteriors of the time .
one gem moment and one gem sequence are present here.the great moment is when a train at a great distance quickly approaches the camera and finally stops just short of it - with buster glumly sitting on the cowcatcher and thus moving from a long shot to a close-up within seconds.the great sequence is with the phone booth next to the elevator - one constantly being mistaken for the other with races from floor to floor - one of the great keaton gags.kino 's print is sharp and clear - almost pristine .
there is a violin/piano score accompaniment .
this is one to seek out and enjoy .
