i thought that this was the most interesting film that jcvd has done in a very long time .
i loved his character and the whole thing with the rabbit set a different tone for this film .
imho , jcdv may really be on to something going forward .
a little more light heartedness , some obvious homages to other films , mixed in with some great fights ... i would like to see more this style of film-making from him .
one of the other posters thought that the bar scene was a desperado rip off .
i immediately saw the r. rodriguez connection also , but thought it was very clever and made me want to see the film again to look for more subtle cues from other films .
jcvd rocks !
!
other stuff after reading other comments : no music in the dungeon fight ?
at first i did n't like that at first either , but then i thought it was interesting because it threw me off balance a bit by giving us something that we did n't expect .
made it seem more real.i also always get a laugh when directors cry like 2 year olds that their film was `` stolen '' from the studio .
directors are paid to do a job .
the studio is the boss and they want the product that they want .
very few directors have absolute final cut on a film .
in this case , jcvd is the talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film .
i am sure he got a film that he was happy with .
i have a relative who works at a post house who knew a little of the story .
presumably , the director worked on and delivered his cut of the film .
everyone who saw it said it was a disaster ... then jcvd and the studio re edited the movie .
this stuff happens all the time .
he also did see the final cut ( which he claims he did n't ) and his `` delicate genius '' ego was severely bruised because they hated his delivered cut .
if this director was smart , he should have taken credit for this one as it would have been his best .
