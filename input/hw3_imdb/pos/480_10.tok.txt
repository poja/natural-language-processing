if you 're tired by the same repetitive , unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases , you 'll enjoy `` you are alone '' .
it is thought provoking , well shot and riveting.without revealing anything that you do n't find out in the first few minutes of the movie , this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor .
the vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to come.through their discussion , you explore two shifting views of prostitution , depression , loneliness .
yet the movie is not depressing .
it talks about dark things without being depressing.as a viewer , your emotions and preconceived notions are moved around , but gently .
you come out of it with a lot to think about .
i like that in a movie .
