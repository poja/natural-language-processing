probably because this is columbia 's first film in color , the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes .
they seem to be stronger , sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic , but very pleasing .
randolph scott is the sheriff , a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young glenn ford , who is an outlaw that wants to change .
evelyn keyes is the woman that starts falling for ford and claire trevor is the countess that runs the saloon .
there is a funny character called nitro that does not think twice before blowing it .
i particularly enjoyed two moments of the film , one when there is a tremendous horse stampede and you see thousands of horses , there was no computer to help at that time , so i presume they must have gathered all those horses , no easy task .
another moment is the final shootout , technically very good .
there is also quite a fistfight .
seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes , makes you come to a sad conclusion : they do n't make them anymore .
would they be able to in case they wanted ?
i have my doubts .
