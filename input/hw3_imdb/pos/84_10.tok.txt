a very good film , focusing on a very important issue .
fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is totally preventable .
if more families saw this film , perhaps more children would not end up like adam .
jimmie smits performs in one of his best roles ever .
this is an excellent movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs .
this is not unlike thousands of families that exist in the united states today .
there are children struggling with this world wide .

more people should see this movie and take what it has to say seriously .
it is well done , with important messages , handled in a graceful way .
