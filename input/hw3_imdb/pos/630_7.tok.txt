this is , without doubt , one of my favourite horror films ever !
i really can not believe that it did n't gain much more popularity when it was released , especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual wes craven sequels and copycat horrors , mute witness has all the style , suspense and quickfire plot twists of a hitchcock/depalma movie , coupled with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot .
it never promises to be any more than a good popcorn-and-hot-dog movie , but it is difficult not to just enjoy the film for what it is.the plot centres on billie hughes - a mute girl working on the set of a horror film being made in a russian factory .
by a series of events , she finds herself accidentally locked in , and stumbles on the filming of a snuff movie.one of the best things about the film is the lack of screaming that seems to invade every horror film ever made .
as the main character is mute , she can not make a noise - something which is a blessing at some stages of the movie , and a curse in others.the director seems to have studied his hitchcock very well , even the opening scene is a tongue-in-cheek nod to both hitchcock 's `` psycho '' as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenes.while the acting can be hammy at times , the whole film does hold it together , not only throwing in a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat , but a few neat little questions about how the film is going to end.all in all , a hugely overlooked , well-paced and action packed psycho-thriller which i would recommend for any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual freddy/jason/scream/michael myers/damien regurgitation 's at hallowe'en .
