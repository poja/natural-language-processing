i really enjoy this movie .
the first time it was on turner classic movies .
all the actors did very well but brynner steals the show again like always ( he is so sexy ! )
.this is one of the movie that you do see brynner 's emotions .
actually this movie this is the first i ever seen him laugh because he plays very strong , larger-than-life and serious roles in other movies .
in this movie you see both a masculine , tough and sensitive side of brynner .brynner seems to be a `` ladies'man '' in this movie.that is amazing how brynner eats the glass cup and speaks in his russian tongue it drives me crazy in love .
i do n't understand when both brynner and kerr ( they both have very good chemistry ) stars in a movie together and then brynner always die at the end it kind of reminds you `` the king and i '' in a way .
