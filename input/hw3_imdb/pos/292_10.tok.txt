this is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world .
the social criticism of our shallow , commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the `` war is hell '' clich√© , underscored by a mythical journey upriver to cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate ( with extreme prejudice ) a rogue colonel , who 's left behind the army 's concepts of justice to create his own world .
when i saw apocalypse now in 1980 , i thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece .
in particular , i found the final segment of the journey with brando , which encapsulates conrad 's heart of darkness , to be rather boring .
i finally got around to seeing apocalypse now redux and the flaws have been taken care of .
redux makes the movie an outright masterpiece , certainly among the top 100 films ever made .
brando 's performance now seems full and complete , perhaps rather less mysterious , but much more profound .
martin sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled .
it 's great to spot a young harrison ford , scott glenn , etc .
in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as .
the work of robert duvall , fred forrest , lawrence fishburne and sam bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage .
if you 've never seen this film , skip the original and head straight for redux .
i wish we could get a gangs of new york redux from scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece .
