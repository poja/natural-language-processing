francis ford coppola 's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of american cinema .
in the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance , open-mindness , and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the united states has ever had .
i am not a historian , but all the events that preceded the decade ( a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the american political and cultural scenes , the racial struggles , the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture , the increase of violence and death in the streets ... ) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare , be different , and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures .
coppola 's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making , following the parameters of war and adventure films , and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life , the reason of death , or the ethics of war .
it is also a passionate work , made against all odds , chronicled in the 1991 documentary `` hearts of darkness : a filmmaker 's apocalypse '' ; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the vietnam war ever to reach the screen .
this may not be the definite vietnam motion picture , but dealing with it coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two vietnam movies made simultaneously , `` the deer hunter '' and `` coming home '' , or in latter ones as `` platoon '' and `` casualties of war '' , before vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre , as horror in `` jacob 's ladder '' , or comedies as `` good morning , vietnam '' , among the more respectable .
coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life , without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war .
