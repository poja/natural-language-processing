the film is a joy to watch , not just for the plot , which is gripping , but also for the superb performances of the actors , deneuve and belmondo .
though considered a 'flop ' on its first release it has become a critical success , and it is clear to see why .
deneuve 's acting style suited the film brilliantly .
she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something , and her character in this film is .
i will not spoil it with saying what , though it is divulged fairly early on .
belmondo is lovable as the fairly naiive but in love tobacconist .
i would recommend this film to all truffaut or deneuve fans .
it is a brilliant hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop as the film does .
the film is approx 2 hrs , so you feel that you have not been sold short .
deneuve steals the show in this film , and it is clear that at the time of making the film truffaut was very much smitten with her .
a definite must see for any cineaste or moviefan .
