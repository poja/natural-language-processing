naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of japanese film , the other two being ozu and mizoguchi .
this is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired geishas .
whatever happens , when such a woman ages , and loses her charm and mystique ?
well , for those who are interested , watch this film .
one : okin , is successful as a money-lender , but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful .
okin does n't have any children , but the other do .
okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her , and is excited .
naruse is a master in subtle studies of his female protagonists ' characters .
bangiku ultimately draws the viewer into the study of the questions of ones happiness , and one 's life-worth .
very good film indeed .
