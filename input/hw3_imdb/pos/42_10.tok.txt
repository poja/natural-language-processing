this is one of those movies that you just do n't want to end .
the characters are rich like a well woven tapestry .
colorful costumes , music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the vietnam war .
a young man is taken in by a dynamic , big-hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiences.i could n't believe this was a made for television film .
it was so well executed .
s. epatha merkerson is wonderful as nanny and she brings so much life to this role .
you want to be right there amongst her boarders.i enjoyed this film so much i bought the dvd .
