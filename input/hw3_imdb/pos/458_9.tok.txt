set during the hungarian revolution of 1956 , this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle jason robards out of hungary into austria .
however , three things complement the story , making this an extremely good movie.first , the actors use the actual languages of their roles .
the russian soldiers speak only russian ; the hungarians only hungarian ; the germans only german , except to the minimal extent to tell the story .
since debra kerr is english , she speaks only english , and , of course , yul brynner and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented english .
as a result , the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount .
the viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when he/she can not understand any of the languages spoken around them .
very powerful feelings are aroused in the audience , and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages , the audience is never at a loss for following the film .
no subtitles are necessary.second .
i was in hungary in 1995 , and i 'm telling you , this movie has it right on .
from the gypsy music overpowering the dinner meal to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes , the realism is incredible .
if i did n't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie , i ate at its double .
i thought that i actually walked down the main street in that village .
( actually , the film was shot in austria ) .third , and most important , this movie reunites deberah kerr and yul brynner ( after the king and i ) and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of oscar qualified .
of course , yul already received an oscar for playing that relationship , so the acadamy was n't going to give him another one , but that is the quality of the film .
do n't miss this one .
