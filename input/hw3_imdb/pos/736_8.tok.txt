clearly my rating for this is not to suggest it compares with the classy horrors of the likes of argento but with other 70s low budget , drive in fare and in that department it truly is a classic .
the lack of money shows , ( does anyone care too much ? )
the acting is adequate rather than professional , ( does that make it more realistic ? )
but unlike so many other movies , and not just low budget ones , this does not drag for a moment .
crap it may be but non stop crap , in your face crap and although inevitably a bit campy at times , this is a must see for anyone who has any idea what i 'm talking about .
at times quite delirious , this crazy little film filled out with crazy characters is clearly made for fun and fun indeed it is to watch .
