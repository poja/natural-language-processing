if you have seen the telugu version of gilli `` okkadu '' you will find this to be very similar in story line , but gilli has different songs and takes place in tamil nadu not andra pradesh .
although this is a remake of `` okkadu '' you will find that vijay and trisha make this a unique film , vijay and trisha make a great pair .
a few negatives were when vijays character slaps trishas character for going to buy a present for him , he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end .
good action and songs make this an all around great movie i recommend it.i give it a 10/10 , one of the best i have seen .
