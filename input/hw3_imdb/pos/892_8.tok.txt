like night stalker and then x-files , the show set up a fantastic situation and the main characters had to sort it out .
unlike these , the hero ( es ) were n't left holding an empty bag at the end .
they had usually tangible results .
it was also made clear that the 'good guys ' were in a dirty profession where they occasionally had to pull some nasty things .
imagination , wit , acting which did n't always take itself too seriously ... i miss it .
one reason being , i 'm hard pressed to think of too many shows - banacek aside - which did as good a job of taking the viewer and grabbing their attention right off the bat .
the writers excelled at setting up hugely improbable , if not downright impossible situations which the characters then had to find an explanation to .
explanations which often took 90 degree turns into the clearly unexpected yet , for all that , still made sense .
too , i agree with another reviewer that the anabelle character was somewhat underused , but when she was on screen , it was n't just for eye candy .
she was quite competent in her own right and stood up to the two male leads when she felt the point she was making warranted it .
a rarity in those days .
sullivan ?
if he was n't in the department , he 'd be working for the kgb or cia .
he 's that sort of coldly efficient , ruthless type .
he knows how the world works and realizes what it can take to get the job done .
king ?
it 's clearly a game to him .
one he excels at and which he parleys into ideas for the detective/spy novels he writes as his ostensible 'real ' job .
he 's probably the most fun to watch of the three , although they all have their moments and often , too .
i do agree that the eventual spin-off series featuring only his character lacked the interest of the original , however .
