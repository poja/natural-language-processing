i 've slowly been collecting the films available on dvd of both catherine deneuve and francois truffaut .
both actress and director have done some stinkers in their time - fortunately mississipi mermaid is not one of them.next to `` the soft skin '' , coincidentally staring deneuve 's sister ( the late francoise dorleac ) , this would have to be my favourite truffaut film.as well as directing , truffaut also wrote the screenplay .
something that always strikes me about truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when presenting a story -- one could almost call it naivety.there 's a scene towards the end of the film where belmondo returns to the apartment in lyon with the remains of the loot .
he rings the doorbell and deneuve answers wearing a negligee .
in the time it takes belmondo to reach their room from the street , deneuve changes into her dress , puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes , then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep .
it 's a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child - but that 's truffaut for you.watching catherine deneuve in her films of the late 60 's is indeed a sensory pleasure .
she is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch .
incidentally , for those fans , there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film - indeed a sinful pleasure.i disagree with previous posters .
i see nothing 'hitchcockian ' about the film at all .
as for the 'look ' of it - i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60 's .
it certainly gives films of this period a unique look.highly recommended for both deneuve and truffaut fans ... ...
