fun , entertaining movie about wwii german spy ( julie andrews ! )
falling in love with american pilot ( rock hudson ) , while trying to get secrets from him .
for some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970 -- i ca n't see why .
it 's beautifully shot , has wonderful costumes and interiors , and exciting aerial dogfights .
also it has andrews doing a strip-tease ( strictly pg material ) and singing a beautiful song -- '' whistling in the dark '' .
the movie does have problems .
andrews and hudson did not get along during the shooting of this -- and it shows .
their love scenes lack spark and they have zero sexual chemistry .
still , they turn in ok performances .
the film is a little long ( even in the 105 min director 's cut i saw ) and gets way too dark and serious at the end .
still , worth catching .
try seeing the directors cut ... the other one runs half an hour longer !
