i 'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur ozon .
i 've seen only 4 films so far , and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions .
not a single non-lonely female character out of 12 , and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings.this film is probably the only one ( out of four ) where this impact is for good.the gay theme is an almost standard part of background for ozon 's films , so it does n't grab the accent ( although the looks of the characters might ) .
watch for the feelings , not for their objects.very nice and fleeting , truly like a summer romance , and while being a relaxation to thought and mind , it gives some food for the soul .
