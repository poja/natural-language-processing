three kids are born during a solar eclipse and turn into vile murderous little tykes who 're above suspicion by everyone , save for joyce ( lori lethin ) and her younger brother timmy .
that 's the story in a nutshell .
the acting in this one is tolerable for the most part .
notable for mtv-j julie brown ( not the 'downtown ' one ) showing some skin , and a very early part ( albiet small ) for michael dudikoff .
not a great film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the 'killer kids ' sub-genre it 's a bit of a guilty pleasure.eye candy : julie brown shows t & a ( the only film thus far , to claim that honor ) ; sylvia wright gets topless dvd extras ( r1 ) : 16 minute interview with producer max rosenberg ( wherein he insults the director and canada , great stuff ) ; biography of ed hunt ; and trailers for `` kiss of the taratula '' , `` do n't open the door '' , & a red-band one for `` homework '' ( which features nudity ) my grade : b-
