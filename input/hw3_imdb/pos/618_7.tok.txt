first half of the movie scared the hell out of me and normally i 'm not easy to scare , but second half of this thriller did n't work quite a well , but still very scary !
a good thriller , than use simple ways to make good horror .
lowbudget , set in russia , unknown cast , and made in europe .
but still great fun , and yes there is a few laughs throw in for good matters as well !
