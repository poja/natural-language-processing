... and i 'm so disappointed because i ca n't seem to buy the dvd or vhs of it anywhere.its a kind of mix of , uncle buck and the great outdoors and molly ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager .
this was made when molly was still a brunette , just before she hit the big time with pretty in pink.i 'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy , with an edge !
if anyone has a copy of this , or knows where i can get one ... please leave a message for me - it 'll be much appreciated .
