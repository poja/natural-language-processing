this is a cult classic for sure !
!
it is tricky to follow at times , but then again , so is a film like jacobs ladder or even say fight club .
if you want standard fare , then i figure go rent the care bears movie or perhaps an old disney classic .
but if you want `` to view the world differently '' then i would say open yourself up to enigma 's and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and think.for me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout .
so while i have seen some complaints , all in all i would say take the film for what it is and enjoy .
