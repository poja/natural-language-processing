... but it 's still an entertaining tv movie .
the transposition to the civil war makes a nice change of pace , and adds a few subtexts ( such as ariel 's servitude to prosper/prospero ) that you might not otherwise see .
thankfully , they did n't try to make it a mini-series : at 90 minutes , it 's just about right .
