after watching oldboy i was a little disappointed by the rest of park 's work , some of it is good but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that oldboy had .
this one does , it is nothing like oldboy in plot or style but the same level of quality is there.the acting is good with kang-ho song , ok-bin kim and ha-kyun shin delivering excellent performances .
kim in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstep.the plot is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big swipe at the vampire clich√©s.the directing is spot on with tons of pace and humour throughout and some of the most memorable scenes i have ever seen .
it does boast what is probably the weirdest love scene you will ever see.this is just a great film .
