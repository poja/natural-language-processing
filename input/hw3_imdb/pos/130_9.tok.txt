the thing which makes `` fire '' even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry , is its touch of femininism and rebellion .
to my mind , the very character played by shabana azmi is a symbol of the indian feminine protest against the indian society .
the name of the movie and the scene when radha walks through flames in her kitchen are symbloic of hindu mythology 's lord rama 's wife sita 's walking through fire for the proof of her immaculacy , as per the same narrative which appears in the film too .
the film could be a great inspiration for women , particularly those in the subcontinent , to search for their liberties and to attain control of their lives .
