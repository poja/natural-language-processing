`` lackawanna blues'is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban blacks during the 50s and early 60s .
a culture of joy and sadness specific to working class blacks that existed outside the mainstream culture .
the characters of santiago-hudson 's play depicted black individuals who lived imperfect lives but maintained strong positive values of love , loyalty and honor .
although the characters moved away from those values at times , they did not deny the importance of the values .
instead they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and those of the other characters , without judgment , that passed through the life of `` nanny '' .
the central characters were strong and believable , the settings were realistic and brought back personal memories of a by-gone era .
pre-integration urban life was a time of sensory intoxication , sight , sound , and smell , that could almost be experienced by watching the drama `` lackawanna blues '' unfold .
i will watch it again and again .
