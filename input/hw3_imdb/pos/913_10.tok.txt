`` they both believed that a hidden sentiment has unified them .
this certitude is beautiful , but the incertitude is more beautiful .
they believed that they had never been met.nothing has happened between them.but those roads , those stairs , those corridors for all that time they could have been met . ''
although it did not mean to be , it was a swan song.two young people , who are neighbors and have never been met , are found in the same places , the same times , doing most of the times the same things.they finally meet in the dramatic and very brilliant end that brings them together.meanwhile the woman has met an old man.their relation is brotherhood-like.he told her his life.it was like the young one 's but with better prospectives.the young man can do whatever the old man has not lived.he can be happy with the woman .
the ending is exceptional.there is a ship wreck.the only survivors are the heros of the `` three colors '' .the man and the woman finally meet.the scene lasts a few seconds.the woman there looks like the photo she had taken for an ad in the beginning of the film ; sad in a red fond .
`` but every start is only the continue.the book of the life is opened in the middle . ''
