i remember this film fondly from seeing it in the theatre .
i recently found a copy on vhs & it held up to my memory of it .
while obviously not a `` big budget '' film , the acting is quite credible & the scenery , locales , & costumes are very well done .
i only wish the mammoths had been in more of the picture , but when you see them , they are also well done ( remember , sfx was done in those days without benefit of computers , some poor devil had to actually put all that hair & fake tusks on real elephants ! )
... the same effect was used on the elephants in `` quest for fire '' .
a better than average adventure film & a chance for the star , rod cameron to play something besides a cowboy , which he also did very well over the years .
