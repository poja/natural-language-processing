art imitates life imitates art .
atticus finch is reincarnated into the d.a .
in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who-done-it and how did it happen .
the authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers .
although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic , integrity , and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again .
the music is driving but not obtrusive ; the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience .
