i really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it .
rita hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous .
although a musical , i thought rita hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well .
as far as her dancing , i think she was excellent .
even betty grable pretty much endorsed rita 's dancing in this film as she commented that rita danced rings around her own dancing and let 's face it , betty grable was an excellent dancer .
the cinematography and vivid colors are also noted .
rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but she 's also in love with her mentor played by gene kelly .
does she leave kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever ?
you 'll have to watch the film to find out !
