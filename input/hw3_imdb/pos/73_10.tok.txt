yes , i am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill !
julie andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the `` whistling in the dark '' production number .
the sedate-to-outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that rock hudson has been seeing a dancing/call girl is eye-popping and will certainly make you giggle.i only wish that this film could be found in video or dvd as i would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library !
