lackawanna blues is an entertaining , engrossing , emotionally-charged hbo-tv movie based on the childhood memories of actor ruben santiago-hudson ( who also appears in a small role ) .
this joyous motion picture experience is centered around santiago-hudson 's childhood guardian , rachel `` nanny '' crosby , a strong , big-hearted black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate new york during the 1950 's .
nanny was a one-woman social service organization whose boarding house was filled with drunks , derelicts , cripples , drug addicts , misfits , and everyone else in town who needed a hand-up instead of a hand-out .
the crux of the story revolves around nanny 's relationship with young ruben ( beautifully played by marcus franklin ) , a boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so nanny took him in .
s. epatha merkeson , who has been wasted for years in the thankless role of lieutenant van buren on nbc 's law & order , turns in a powerhouse performance as nanny , the neighborhood mother-figure whose boarding house became a symbol for the downtrodden black folks in her town .
merkeson is nothing short of magnificent , in a performance that earned her a golden globe and an emmy award .
merkeson is backed by an impressive all-star cast that includes terrance howard ( brilliant and heartbreaking as nanny 's husband ) , louis gossett jr. , rosie perez , jimmy smits , delroy lindo , macy gray , michael k. williams , jeffrey wright , henry simmons , patricia wettig , ernie hudson , mos def , and hill harper as the adult ruben .
colorful and exciting , beautifully photographed and exquisitely scored , this is one of a kind motion picture experience that works on all levels , but if for no other reason , is worth seeing for the electrifying starring performance by s. epatha merkeson , who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it .
