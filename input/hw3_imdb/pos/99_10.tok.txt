this movie , with all its complexity and subtlety , makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films i have ever seen .
the topics it addresses are ugly , cynical , and at times , even macabre , but the film remains beautiful in its language , artful with its camera angles , and gorgeous in its style , skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories , tobias wolff.not wishing to spoil anything of the movie , i wo n't go into any details , other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself .
it takes pride in what it does , and does it well .
it shows the most important memories of life , all of which can be topped by the single most elusive feeling : unexpected bliss .
this movie , of its own volition , has created in me the same feelings the main character ( tom noonan ) felt when words transformed his very existence , and that is one impressive feat .
