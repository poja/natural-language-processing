this is an incredible movie that begins slowly .
it leads you along in thinking of it as a typical maudlin family drama .
then , in the second half , there is a plot twist that utterly transforms this into a profound tale of global scope.if you are unaccustomed to films from india , with song and dance routines seemingly grafted on for no reason , stick with this movie .
especially beginning with the second half , you will find this movie an amazing experience .
*********** minor spoiler here ************* i have but one complaint with the movie .
the dialog at the end ( between amudha and mds ) seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to bring in the war as a force that transforms people 's lives .
it was implied all along , but there should have been something about the importance of the struggle for mds .
