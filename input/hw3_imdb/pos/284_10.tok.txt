with the obvious exception of fools & horses , this was in my opinion david jason 's finest series.coming straight after his tv debut on 'do not adjust your set ! '
, these 13 episodes revealed a mastery of comic timing not seen since the old silent movie days .
by comparison , porridge , open all hours and that awful series 'lucky man ' did not come close.i believe jason banned the series being repeated because it showed him at his rawest .
shame on him .
a new generation deserves to enjoy this .
the series actually flopped in the ratings but that is most likely because it was shown against 'the brothers ' which aired on bbc at the same time , before vcrs were commonplace.btw , i have only just noticed that his long suffering assistant , spencer , was played by mark eden ; alan bradley off coronation street .
i am amazed he did n't try to murder edgar briggs !
