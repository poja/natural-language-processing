i 'd heard about this movie , but did n't see it until my daughter , who saw it on a flight to australia , told me it was a great movie .
i was interested in seeing whether rupert grint , away from harry potter , was showing the promise you see in the potter movies .
i was n't disappointed .
he 's become a fine actor , showing a range in driving lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over-bearing obsessive mother , to a young man finding himself to be worthy of his own , and other 's , esteem .
going over lines from plays and poetry with his aging-actress employer , it 's obvious that he 's ready to take on much more complex roles in films and the stage .
but the jewel of this movie was julie walters .
i 'd seen her previously in the potter movies , billy elliott and calendar girls , and loved her .
in driving lessons , as she does lines from poetry and shakespeare , i was awed by her timing , command of the language , and body language .
i 'm hoping it was make-up/costuming , as she portrays an older woman with osteoporosis , though no mention of it is made in the movie -- as a nurse , i can say that she did this perfectly , portraying a woman on the brink of old-age , but clinging to the sparkling past that she reveled in .
this is one of the best movies i 've seen in a long time , and i wish i 'd seen it in a theatre first -- but i doubt it ever played anywhere here in albuquerque .
we miss out on so many of these types of movies here .
