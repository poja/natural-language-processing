wayne wang 's direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than `` slums of beverly hills '' , which covers remarkably similar ground .
the interplay between susan sarandon and natalie portman is riveting .
real chemistry there .
this film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration .
susan sarandon 's character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent .
she amazingly manages to do this without coming across as floridly insane or intentionally sadistic .
and , natalie portman deflects each attack on her character 's ego with the resigned grace of an intelligent codependent child , untainted by the smug cynicism of the natasha lyonne character in `` slums of beverly hills '' .
portman 's character is an adolescent with dignity under stress , an unusual creature in modern films .
the film reaches a very satisfying resolution without trying too hard .
i highly recommend this film to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained .
