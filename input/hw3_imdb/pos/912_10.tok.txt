this movie is not only about feelings and human emotions , it is also about everything that could be but it 's not .
poetry in movies can be awfully boring and annoying , but this movie is delightful to be watched .
not to mention the amazing irène jacob , a great actress in france - one of the best , actually .
when the movie ends , you can only feel sorry .
after all , when something is truly great , we want more ( well , for another great movie by k kieslowsky with irène jacob we can always watch la double vie de veronique )
