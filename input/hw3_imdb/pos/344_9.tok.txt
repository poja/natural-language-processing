i saw this film at the 2002 toronto international film festival.this is the first indian film i 've seen in the tamil language , and while it does share some similarities with other indian films ( wonderful music and choreography , sweeping storyline ) , the director attempts more than just to entertain .
the film tells the story of amudha , a precocious nine-year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted , thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from india to war-torn sri lanka .
gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point , though it is a simplistic one .
amudha is played by p.s .
keerthana , and she is one of the few child actors i 've seen who can be precocious and yet not annoying .
her charm and beauty held the film together .
