i still count `` police squad ! ''
as the absolute funniest tv show of the 1980s .
somewhere , on betamax no less , i have all six episodes .
i knew that a show this good would n't last and that i had to preserve it for myself .
how stupid was abc ?
they were quoted as saying that viewers did n't know that `` police squad ! ''
was a comedy because it had no laugh track !
right !
when drebin has a line like `` you take chances just getting up in the morning , driving to work , or sticking your face in a fan .
`` , how can that be comedy !
?
!
?
i 've seen every episode at least ten times and still see something new i missed before .
even the deep backgrounds always have gags ongoing .
do n't miss it if you have chance to see an episode , but if you 're reading this then you probably already have copies squirreled away someplace as i do .
