i loved this show .
i think the first time i tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show .
was n't the shop located like right on the beach or something ?
i actually wrote back and forth with marci for several years .
i lost touch and wish i could reconnect now as adults .
anyone know where she is now ?
i wish they would put it out on dvd .
i seriously doubt that since i think there maybe like five or six people who even remember the show airing in the first place .
they just do n't make shows like this anymore , do they ?
i wonder if it would still hold up in this day and age .
do you guys know anyone that could burn dvd 's of the show they taped on vhs ?
i 'd be willing to pay ( within reason ) .
