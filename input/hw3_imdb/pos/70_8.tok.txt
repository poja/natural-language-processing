this movie is certainly well-constructed , beginning and ending in the dark , with focus on lili smith /schmidt , julie andrews , initially the singing 'angel ' later the notorious spy.it 's beautiful !
i saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently .
while it was dismissed by critics in the 70 's as overblown , 'cinema vulgaris ' , and lacking in structure ( among others ) time has proven them wrong .
blake edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality.the film soars and swirls ( aerial photography ; julie andrews in motion ) and captivates .
one must just buy into the premise that julie andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong .
overlooking the tepid chemistry between julie andrews and rock hudson , one must believe that these are lovers - who in all innocence fall for each other .
and in the end , love is far more important than winning wars .
and so is maintaining innocence.there is a lot of understated acting , and the film certainly reaches emotional depths often not seen in comedies.there are wonderful comedic elements ( foreshadowing the french goons in victor/victoria ) , interesting diplomatic asides ( reminding me of the tamarind seed , seen about 18 years ago ) and a general sense of good-will.suspend all disbelief and this movie will carry you away .
julie andrews ' belting out of war songs and the haunting 'whistling away the dark ' are reason enough to turn the tv on , just for the soundtrack .
and the striptease number , like the 'jenny ' number in star !
works .
this film has , like a good champagne , aged well .
paramount should bring it to dvd as soon as possible .
the same applies to transferring the laser disk of star !
to dvd .
these are both interesting pieces of julie andrews ' meticulous and then underrated works .
