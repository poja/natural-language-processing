most of kieslowski 's films seem like puzzles to me , meant to expand mind and soul .
the characters are not very believable , are idealized , are schematic .
nevertheless , the way kieslowski presents their winding ways through life , their complicated interaction with others , with the universe , with chance or destiny , makes me understand faith , makes me ( want to ) believe in god .
that at some point it all has a meaning , if not to me , then certainly to someone.trois couleurs and especially `` rouge '' comes closer to making me touch , feel , experience the `` truth '' , the `` meaning '' than perhaps any other of his films .
the only problem being the paths of the `` puzzles '' explored are a bit too similar to his other films and at some point they become somewhat predictable .
there is still plenty of joy to be had here .
it is like a familiar brand of wine - you know what to expect and it delivers , sometimes with a newly found bouquet which might come from aging - either the wine or yourself .
