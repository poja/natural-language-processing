this is a well-crafted piece from everyone 's favorite master of suspense .
as usual , the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding ( especially for the film 's time ) .
i did not find the first part of the film very exciting , but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after another.the only thing i did not like about this movie was the choice of farley granger for the part of guy haines .
somehow , i did n't find him very believable .
on the other hand , robert walker shines as sinister 'bad guy ' bruno anthony.overall , i would highly recommend this .
