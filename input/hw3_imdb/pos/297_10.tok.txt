brilliant actors and brilliant picture !
!
i love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning , it is just so touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic !
the vietnam war was far from human and i believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances .
modern war movies are spending so much money on effects .
this is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination .
a movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate .
how insane the world is and the power of will and friendship , love and passion .
a must seen movie and without any doubts the best war movie ever !
many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this !
