for a moment , let 's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie , even if it is a very important side of it , and let 's look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story .
two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation , caused by two selfish husbands .
they have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope .
if each one of these two women had been alone , imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept .
they found each other and they fell in love .
that this love was against all the social , religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant .
they loved each other , found relief in each other , that was sufficient .
the reaction of the individuals around them is but a small fact that they have to accept , suffer even , and then they can go on with their lives , their life .
very nice .
