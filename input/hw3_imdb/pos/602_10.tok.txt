jim henson as kermit , dr.teeth , rowlf and waldorf.frank oz as fozzie , piggy and animal.jerry nelson as floyd pepper , robin the frog , lew zealand and crazy harry.richard hunt as janice , statler , beaker and scooter.dave goelz as gonzo , dr.hunnydew and zoot.charles durning and mel brooks.cameos by steve martin , carol kane , orson welles , bob hope , richard pryor and others.this is the first muppet movie of the billion others that came out , and is also the best , by far !
this deals with kermit the frog going on a trip to hollywood and meeting the other characters along the way .
this movie , along with being already good , has excellent songs performed by the muppets , including rainbow connection , can you picture that ?
, moving right along and others .
this movie , unlike the other muppet flicks , carries a strong sentimental value to me .
it 's such a nice movie .
also noted is it 's many cameos featuring steve martin , mel brooks and a dozen others.my rating-a plus .
