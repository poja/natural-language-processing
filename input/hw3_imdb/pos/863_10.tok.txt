when i first saw stella on comedy central i thought `` god , this is horrible ! ''
but i loved wet hot american summer .
so i knew something did n't make sense .
there was nothing left for me to do but search out for the stella shorts which i had heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe out there .
when i found them not only were my dildo expectations met , but i found probably the greatest comedy scenes i 've seen in years .
the set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs .
not only did i laugh my ass off the first time i watched them but continued to laugh harder when i watched them over and over again .
it 's really a shame comedy central had the restrictions of cable television for the stella series .
it would have faired much better on hbo or showtime .
their brand of humor ca n't be restricted by censors or popular culture .
given even if it was on hbo i 'm sure the `` masses '' would have voted it canceled in a season or less , but still it would have been fantastic .
needless to say i 'm now in love with stella and all it 's individual members .
any stella fan should check out david wain 's site with all his short films .
they are equally as enjoyable as stella itself .
so my hat goes off to michael showalter , michael ian black , and david wain for the unbelievable comedy they have made with stella .
i hope to see much more of the troupe in the future .
