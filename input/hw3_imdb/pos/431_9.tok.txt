i made a promise that if ever i posted a comment that was less than complimentary , then later felt different about it , i would return and make known my change of heart .
so far , this is the first time it 's happened .
i 'm really starting to enjoy hack .
something has clearly changed .
the storylines seem to be much stronger .
the plot may still be a tad surreal , but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven .
i attribute this to fine acting .
not every show can come charging out of the starting gate a winner .
some need time to pick up speed .
i 'm glad i kept watching this program , and i really hope it lasts .
