they say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer- to hide certain details from the audience in order to tickle their sense of imagination , dip into their fears and let that give birth to their darkest thoughts.that was not the case when i watched bakjwi , under the american title thirst .
now playing at select theaters near you .
seems like the film makers did not want to spare you any details .
there will be blood in this film and you will try to look away.for rest of review please visit http : //without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi.html thanks and hope you enjoyed reading above .
