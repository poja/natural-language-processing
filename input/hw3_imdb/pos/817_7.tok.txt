i saw this movie for the first time when quentin tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the alamo drafthouse in austin .
he prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation , it was hilarious .
i can see how it would be damaging to some audiences , and the subject is not funny at all , but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard i thought i 'd pee .
they do n't come until after the halfway point , but when they do , oh god ... you will die .
oh and jim brown is brilliant .
he 's not in a lot of the movie , but when he 's there , you know whose movie it is .
naturally , the best line in the movie ( and the funniest ) is his ; you 'll know it when you hear it .
