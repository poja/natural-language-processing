when i was young , i was a big fan of the naked gun movies but just recently i watched the show police sqaud !
and i think its great !
leslie nielson 's awesome , alan north is cool , and who the heck is rex hamilton ?
but anyways , it 's one goofy show.one of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits .
i think my favorite one is when norberg ( not o.j . )
walks in during the scene and he tries to fit in with the freeze frame .
classic !
the only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old ( when drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks , `` cigarette ? ''
and the person replies , `` yes .
i know . ''
) i think they used it too many times by whatever.good acting , good gags , great show !
