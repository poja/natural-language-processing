what some hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed , creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons ( without becoming unrealistic ) , manages this beautiful movie perfectly well ( resembling in that way a little to the wonderful 'la double vie de veronique ' of the same director and with the same beautiful actress ) .
this is a real movie , that changes perspective of life a little bit - intelligent and beautiful story , masterfully directed , excellent main actors , masterful cinematography .
i 've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time , and i still think it 's one of the best i 've ever seen .
and if you should be unhappy with the ending of 'white ' - 'red ' puts an happy end to the whole trilogy .
