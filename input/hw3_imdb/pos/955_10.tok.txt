am an ardent vijay fan .
i have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this.it has all the regular clich√©s that one can expect from a commercial entertainer .
a hero who is bad in studies but a star in his forte i.e.kabbadi .
his friends to fill in the comedy quota .
a heroine in a life-and-death situation .
a villain , which i say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist .
high octane chase and action sequences .
music that can make one dance .
and above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle .
perfect.the director does n't give any chance for the audience to loosen up .
he just goes on from one nail on the head to the next .
and one can see the lighter side of vijay in this film which he rarely executes.all said ... ..this movie was and will be perfect for many years to come ... .
