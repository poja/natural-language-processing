genius or utter madness ?
that depends on your interpretation of this film .
i responded to it on the level of a self-aware `` cop-movie parody '' , and i sincerely hope that was the intention as i do n't see anyone taking it seriously !
: -d paul rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things !
is this film supposed to mark a departure for rudd from his core background in the comedy genre ?
some kind of insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard-boiled action star ?
i think not !
with the cheesy , almost awkward acting , low budget fx , and zany over-the-top action set pieces , it all kinda evoked that old tv show `` sledge hammer '' for me !
hilarious !

: - ) of course , i may have totally interpreted the film wrong .
if it was in fact an attempt at a 'straight ' action movie , then it was certainly an amusing failure !

watch with lots of alcohol and some mates !
