gene roddenberry never let his fans down .
his death ended sci-fi legacy that will never be matched .
earth : the final conflict was proof !
his pilot film and the first 2 seasons were well written and meticulously produced , but somewhere along the way the roddenberry touch was lost .
the loss of lead , kevin kilner ( william boone ) definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work .
the story involves the human race being visited by the taelons , an extra-terrestrial race who dub themselves 'the companions ' .
after 3 years they have given earth new technologies , helpful information about the universe and more .
many question their intentions here on earth .
the main liaison on earth between the races is da'an ( leni parker ) and he is to many , the most trustworthy taelon .
questions arise : just why are they here ?
what are their goals , is da'an aware of any suspected plots against the humans ?
there is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist jonathan doors ( david hemblen ) who utilizes his millions to investigate the taelons .
by the end of the first season things are going well , da'an seems trustworthy , boone assists doors in his investigation while working with da'an and the taelons as a liaison .
in the middle of the 2nd season things start unraveling and the once terrific and fascinating series spirals downward , mostly because roddenberry had died and was not around to guide the producers , of whom his wife majel barrett-roddenberry was co-producer .
still , the first season remains intriguing and fun to watch .
