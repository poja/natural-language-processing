to say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all .
after all , this show is made by the same crew responsible for airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies .
writing is superb .
even though the show is built on one-liners , they do n't become overbearing or annoying .
leslie nielsen is flexing his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying : you ai n't seen nothing yet .
the format was definitely polished to introduce naked gun .
when watching these movies , notice how many schticks are taken from the tv show .
the brilliant part is that they do n't have to be changed too much .
the show was truly a testing ground for bigger and better versions to come later .
