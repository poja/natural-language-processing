in the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations , blade is by far one of the best realised , and most faithful ( overall ) to the source material ... .
given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in marvel 's tomb of dracula , the writer took almost all of the characters and plot elements from the comic 's history .
while changes were inevitably made , the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms .
do n't let any of you friends tell you different : blade is one fine film .
if it feels too `` comic booky '' for you stanley kubrick snobs out there , it 's because it 's supposed to .
deal with it , but do n't dis it for it .
