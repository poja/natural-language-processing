the mario series is back , and in my opinion , better than ever .
galaxy is the most creative mario yet ; even more so than super mario 64. the controls are great ; some of the best for the wii .
beautiful graphical design as well .
the levels are very big , and the good old bosses are back .
there is tons to explore in this game ; definitely a high level of replay value .
i only have 2 complaints : 1 : the story is a little to similar to mario 64. and 2 : the difficulty is n't very high ; though it does require some patience .
mario fans : the game you 've been waiting for .
casual gamers : this game is more than worth the buy .
9.8 out of 10 .
