this is one of my three all-time favorite movies .
my only quibble is that the director , peter yates , had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene , but the performances were so great i forgive him.albert finney and tom courtenay are absolutely marvelous ; brilliant .
the script is great , giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during world war ii ( and , therefore , what it was like in the 30s as well ) .
lots of great , subtle touches , lots of broad , overplayed strokes , all of it perfectly done .
scene after scene just blows me away , and then there 's the heartbreaking climax .
