i first saw this movie as a teenager when it came out in theaters , way back when .
seeing it again , nearly 30 years later , i was surprised at how well it has held up .
the gags are still funny , the interaction between characters works great , and the cameos come off better than ever .
( steve martin 's has to be the best one . )
my kids ( 9 , 11 , and 14 ) all loved it , and the music is good enough that they are still humming the tunes many days later.i would suggest that before seeing the movie , you should view at least a half-dozen episodes of the muppet show , to get a sense of the back-story behind the characters , otherwise the movie wo n't make all that much sense .
