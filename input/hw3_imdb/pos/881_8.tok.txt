unlike bond and other detective movies , alfred hitchcock 's hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his acumen and courage ( and luck ) would get out of it .
jewel thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is vijay anand 's tribute to the master of suspense .
the tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes vijay anand as a great director himself.it is the story of a common man vinay who one day realizes that he has a double called amar who in fact is a jewel thief .
suddenly vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatching scheme and to save himself goes on a wild goose chase to find this amar who remains one step ahead of him .
the suspense is almost killing throughout the movie and as the plot unravels you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme .
just like hitchcock 's movies , jewel thief can boast of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of sikkim.everyone and i mean everyone ; dev anand , vijay anand , ashok kumar , vajyanti mala , tanuja , sd burman , kishore kumar , majrooh sultanpuri etc .
etc .
are in their top forms .
this is one of the best thrillers ever made in india .
