i am not a fan of musicals , but i am a huge fan of jean renoir and jean gabin .
i rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly surprised even expecting greatness from the classic director .
this movie is beautiful .
the shots are like oil paintings with motion , something a lot of directors strive for but renoir masters .
i can not express how much this movie transcends itself ... it 's not really a musical , it just has a couple of well-placed musical numbers and a grand dancing finale .
but there is something about this movie in particular which makes you feel absolute joy when watching it.i am a fan of foreign art films , but i 'm also a meathead who loves things like die hard and schwarzenegger movies .
i get very easily turned off by things that are overly happy or in `` la la land , '' but this movie has an overwhelming positive energy that is just irresistible -- not to mention every frame is gorgeous and the plot is good .
10 out of 10 .
