i love this movie .
it is the first film master p have ever done .
it is based on the story of his life .
it is low-budget , but it is very good .
it shows how master p grew up in projects in new orleans.not only did master p start in this movie , he also was the writer and director with moon jones .
the dvd also has the no limit ice cream party on it .
this movie shows how master p goes from bad too good and how he had to deal with the things around him .
it also has many of the no limit records roster in this film .
you should buy or rent this film.it is a great movie to watch is you like rap , or is a master p fan .
