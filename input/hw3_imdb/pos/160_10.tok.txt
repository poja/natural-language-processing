not for the squeamish , but the number of twists , inventive uses of situations using vampire mythology , gorgeous visual extremes , together with interesting and quirky characters make this one of the most stunning horror films i 've ever seen .
it descends into utter madness along with characters , but never seems exploitative or horrific without purpose .
there are copious amounts of bloodletting accompanied by some nasty sucking and squishing sounds , but also subtle moments where you laugh out loud .
as he tends to do , chan-wook park keeps you off center with leaps in time and plot and situation that you have to fill in for yourself forcing your involvement in the story and characters .
and there 's a lot of literal leaping .
keeping in the vein of vampire myth ( pun intended ) , they have superhuman strength and can nearly leap tall buildings in a single bound ( to coin a phrase ) .
the first time our heroine is carried by the across the tops of buildings by the troubled vampire priest , it has all the magical romance of lois lane and superman - but this romance becomes increasingly disturbing - but driven by a strange and conflicted 'love affair ' not by mere horror.the acting is superb , particularly ok-vin kim , the gorgeous actress in the female lead role who , at 22 , shows a range that is remarkable .
the character borders on a kind of black widow film noir type .
she careens from innocent to impish to vixen to demon with utter conviction .
this is a really smooth and nervy performance .
if you love real art in horror , or are a fan of oldboy - do n't wait for the video , see it immediately .
