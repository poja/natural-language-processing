this was a great movie .
something not only for black history month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child .
the performances by s eptath was outstanding .
mos def and his singing was off the hook .
had to do a double take when i saw that was rosie perez there .
but the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching .
all the different stories they had was amazing .
and how nanny protected jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence .
i can truly understand her being the matriarch of that time period and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone .
cant wait for it to come out on dvd .
it would be a welcome addition to any movie library .
