jim henson 's the muppet movie is a charming , funny and brilliant film that can be watched and enjoyed by adults and kids .
i feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters , great story , and great wit that it is irresistable .
the plot involves kermit the frog ( puppeteered and voiced by henson ) in his odyssey across america to follow his dream in hollywood .
along the way , he meets fozzie bear , the great gonzo ( my favorite ) , miss piggy , rolf , and dr. teeth and the electric mayhem.this film has so many good things i ca n't even say them .
but it is memorable and every time i think of a puppet or muppet , i will think of this film .
look for cameos from mel brooks , dom delouise , paul williams , madeline kahn , bob hope , richard pryor , steve martin , edgar bergen ( and charlie mccarthey ) , elliot gould , carol kane and the great orson welles .
excellent and spectacular , one of the best films of the 70 's .
