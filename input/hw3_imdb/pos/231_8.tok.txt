the most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors , the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dances .
this typical rising-star musical has an overworked plot , even for 1944 , but because of the actors it 's still fun to watch .
hayworth is n't even that much of a dancer , but she has a lot of 'inexperienced ' charm that fits her character .
kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role while silvers provides plenty of self-deprecation and laughs .
the movie can also be very serious at times .
not a must-see , but recommended if you like the actors .
