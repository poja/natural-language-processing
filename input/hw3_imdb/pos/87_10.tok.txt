it has been years since i have been privileged to see this movie on tv .
i only wish i could contact someone to see it again .
i married a man with three children and two had fetal alcohol syndrome .
i did n't ' realize this but seeing this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how i can love them and help them overcome their difficulties .
my step-son is now 35 and thank the lord he has blossomed wonderfully but still has many after affects of being born by an alcoholic mother .
we speak every month to rehab patients with alcohol and drug addictions and this sharing has truly made monumental changes in their behaviors and endeavors to start out a new life not addicted to drugs and alcohol .
please please let me know how i can get a copy vhs or dvd of this movie or when they will show the movie again on tv .
if you have not been in these shoes , you probably could never understand its value .
thank you so very much .
