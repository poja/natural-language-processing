story about three eclipse ( maybe even indigo , ha ) children beginning their love for murder .
oh , and the people who are `` hot '' on their trail.bloody birthday , a pretty mediocre title for the film , was a nice lil surprise .
i was in no way expecting a film that dealt with blood-thirsty psychopath kids .
and i may say it 's also one of the best flicks i 've seen with kids as the villains .
by the end of the movie i seriously wanted these kids to die in horrible fashion.it 's a really solid 80s horror flick , but how these kids are getting away with all this mayhem and murder is just something that you ca n't not think about .
even the slightest bit of investigation would easily uncover these lil sh !
ts as the murderers .
but there seems to be only a couple police in town , well by the end , only one , and he seemed like a dimwit , so i suppose they could have gotten away with it .
haha , yeah , and i 'm a chinese jet-pilot.nevertheless , this movie delivered some evilass kids who were more than entertaining , a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage .
no kiddin !
if you 're put off by the less than stellar title , dash it from your mind and give this flick a shot .
it 's a very recommendable and underrated 80s horror flick .
