i saw this movie on my flight from philly to denver .
the screen was three rows in front of me and about 12 '' x 10 '' .
so i really was n't going to watch it .
but i like malcolm in the middle , so i thought i 'd watch just a few minutes .
next thing i know i 'm sucked in , having a great time , and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by .
i agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment .
being one of the older baby boomers , i was also pleased to see lee majors with a role in the movie , as with a couple of other actors who were famous ( jamiel ? )
`` yesterday '' but are out of the spotlight today poking fun at themselves.it 's your basic `` kid is wronged , kid gets even ( and then some ) , and everyone enjoys themselves in the process '' .
no heavy thinking , no great analysis needed .
just a good fun way to pass the time.3.5 out of 5 .
