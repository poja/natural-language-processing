i saw the film at the brooklyn international film festival ( world premiere ) .a haunting , intimate portrait of loneliness , and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker.the acting of the two leads ( jessica bohl & richard brundage ) is excellent , and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged.reminded me in theme of the works of atom egoyan ( exotica ) and raymond carver ( where i 'm calling from ) .the soundtrack ( tywanna jo baskette , crooked fingers ) is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself.highly recommend the film and the soundtrack .
