i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie .
i 've never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels .
they just do n't make movies like this anymore.after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film ( hearts of darkness : a filmmakers journey into madness ) , i 'm even more amazed that this film even got finished , yet alone turn out so great.the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the phillipines is the film 's greatest asset .
you actually feel like your in vietnam.all of the actors are fantastic with my favorites still being robert duvall ( `` i love the smell of napalm in the morning !
! ''
) martin sheen , and the great marlon brando.a lot of people complain that the film gets too murky , weird and cerebral near the end .
well , remeber what coppolla said about this movie , `` this film is not about vietnam , it is vietnam ! ''
what he means is that this film is about madness and not the war.this movie is based on the short story `` heart of darkness '' by joseph conrad and is set against the vietnam war instead of the civil war as in the book .
i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinion.this is perfect , challenging film that is dark , violent , humorous at times and well done in every single possible way.a true classicrating:10
