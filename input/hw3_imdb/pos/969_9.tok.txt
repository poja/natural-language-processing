big fat liar , in my opinion , is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it .
when jason ( frankie muniz - `` malcolm in the middle '' ) and kaylee ( amanda bynes - `` all that '' ) played those tricks on marty ( paul giamatti - doctor dolittle ) , i really smiled and felt good .
that 's what i liked most about this movie .
as a matter of fact , everything that happened after jason 's essay erroneously ended up in marty 's hands was hilarious .
i especially loved jaleel white 's cameo .
when i first saw him , i could n't be certain , but , when i asked my mother if it was him , she said , `` of course ! ''
before i wrap this up , i 'd like to say , `` like i said earlier , there is a moral to this story , and that moral is , always tell the truth . ''
now , in conclusion , if you are a fan of frankie muniz , amanda bynes , or paul giamatti , i highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it .
