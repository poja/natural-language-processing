i thought i was going to watch another friday the 13th or a halloween rip off , but i was surprised , it 's about 3 psycho kids who kill , there 's not too many movies like that , i can think of mikey , children of the corn and a few others , it 's not the greatest horror movie but it 's a least worth a rent .
