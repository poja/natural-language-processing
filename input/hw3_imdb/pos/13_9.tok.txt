i work at a movie theater and every thursday night we have an employee screening of one movie that comes out the next day ... today it was the guardian .
i saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much from it , and in no way really did i anticipate seeing this movie .
well turns out this movie was a lot more than i would have thought .
it was a great story first of all .
ashton kutcher and kevin costner did amazing acting work in this film .
being a big fan of that 70 's show i always found it hard thinking of kutcher as anyone but kelso despite the great acting he did in the butterfly effect , but after seeing this movie i think i might be able to finally look at him as a serious actor.it was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the u.s. coast guard .
