its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires .
what does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms ?
one husband finds outlet with the immigrant - since immigrants do n't belong or are n't accepted , they do n't need to conform and dam their desires .
the other husband looks for solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness .
it fails - of course - and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons .
sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires .
the mother in her still could n't find the strength to destroy his myth .
she sees him as a child who is glorifying himself in his lust-control but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow up ?
both the wives find courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband .
but the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept sita 's desire .
a decade and more of receiving care was not enough to break the shackles of her culture.seems like it was easiest for the househelp to let his desires flow - since he 's anyway damned by his culture - being at the bottom of the hierarchy .
since there is anyway no respect and expectations , might as well taste sin .
