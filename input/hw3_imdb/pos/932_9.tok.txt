it is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of kieslowski 's trilogy , it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite : view them in order , blue , white , and red , and consider them together as one complete work .
it is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes : liberty , equality , fraternity , and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry .
they are each well worth seeing independently , but i believe they are best seen as one work .
collectively , i would rate the trilogy as a 9 ; separately , i place each in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994.the color red is most memorable in the third movie as a backdrop in a billboard ad , the profiled model of which is the central of the movie 's three main characters .
the other two characters do a double-take of a varying degree of recognition when they first come upon the ad , posted larger than life alongside a busy city intersection .
this ad is not a major part of the plot of this movie , yet its image becomes striking and is one of the reasons i have called red a `mind-bending ' film .
this is the third of kieslowski 's three colors trilogy , based on the blue-white-red of the french flag and the three parts of its motto , `liberty , equality , fraternity . '
the films stay primarily focused on these themes , keeping with the basic levels of one , two , or three main characters , yet with each film the complexity of plot escalates as the three principles move from fundamentally personal ( liberty , blue ) to relational ( equality , white ) to social ( fraternity , red ) .
red is my favorite of these films , and i give it a 9. it stands by itself as a great film , but one should see blue and white first for the fullest effect .
