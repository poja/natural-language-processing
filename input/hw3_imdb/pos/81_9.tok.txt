a savage , undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival .
he suddenly notices a hole on the floor of his cell , then sticks his nose into this hole to snuff it .
at first he thinks bugs bunny 's home is belong to a camel ; yet when he wakes bugs up from his sleep hoisting him up to the ground , there he meets with bugs , his next trainer .
if you ever wonder how bugs would turn a savage lion into a hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on , you should watch this cartoon .
director bob mckimson offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour .
the signature scenes include:1/ the look of bugs bunny 's home , cross-referencing to donald duck with the b.b .
name acronym on the headboard of bugs 's bed 2/ bugs bunny 's short journey with the mine hoist climbing up to the ground floor 3/ when nero the lion calls his friend the elephant for help , bugs uses a toy mouse to scare the elephant ; since the elephant needed a broom to outpower that toy mouse , he uses nero as a broom !
4/ bugs becoming a clown with the proper costume and make-up and the practical clown jokes that he makes 5/ the trapeze scene while nero chasing after bugs 6/ the famous human cannonball scene after which nero the lion starts dancing hawaiian hulathe magic moments which keep acrobatty bunny fresh at all times in our memory:1/ when bugs comes out of his bunny hole , he thinks he 's in the pinocchio tale ; and starts acting to save pinocchio out of the giant whale 's stomach 2/ when the lion roars to scare him , bugs replies back to him with roaring3/ bugs arguing with the lion for he 's making so much noise , then finding a piece of wood to rub it against the iron bars while singing in order to make more noise than him 4/ wearing rubber heels at the circus , bugs starts to bounce like toy rabbits and causes nero to bounce !
