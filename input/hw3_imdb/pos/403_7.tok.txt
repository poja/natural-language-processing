another nice entry in the crime doctor series [ # 4/10 ] , with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid spanish american backdrops and sets .
and a more off-the-wall storyline too !
a man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party .
the crime doctor is on the scene ( ostensibly as a guest ) to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder , and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over , for one of them did the deed .
was it the frothing brother of the dead 1st wife , the 3rd wife and rich widow hilary brooke , the dancing brother and sister vampires , the intense young man , the eccentric cabinet maker lloyd corrigan on loan from boston blackie , the irreplaceable butler , or odds-on jerome cowan ?
police inspector emory parnell had his work cut out , but warner baxter as ordway was as unflappable as ever in working it all out .
one of the goofs listed on the imdb is wrong : on breaking into the murder room ordway says `` right through the centre of the forehead '' and cowan replies `` he did n't miss this time '' .
favorite bits : baxter and cowan travelling through club sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make amends for their interrupted dinner party ; the scene where the braga 's place of repose is seemingly rumbled .
the plot does seem to meander a bit at times and the way it was all explained off was perhaps more worthy of monogram , but leaving it in the air as supernatural would n't do either !
well worth a watch if you already like the genre , you wo n't be disappointed unless you really do n't like the genre .
