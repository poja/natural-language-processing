my mother frank begins as a warm , amiable comedy about a middle-aged catholic woman ( frank , short for francis , played by sinead cusack ) who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student in her son 's university .
most of her friends and family are horrified , not least her son ( matthew newton ) , who is busy falling in love with his best mate 's girlfriend ( rose byrne ) .
meanwhile frank has raised the ire of her disapproving english tutor ( sam neill ) .matthew newton is utterly disarming as david ; relaxed and natural in the role , even when the character 's uptight .
he generates valuable goodwill , steering the audience through some of the film 's more awkward , broad comedy moments .
not long after the half-way point , first-time writer-director mark lamprell expertly steers his film into darker emotional territory and gives cusack a real chance to shine.the supporting cast is full of familiar and welcome faces ( lynette curran , sacha horler , nicholas bishop ) and all the principals ( including a more animated than usual sam neill ) are excellent .
while it meanders a little towards the end , my mother frank delivers more than it promises and is a genuine australian crowd-pleaser .
