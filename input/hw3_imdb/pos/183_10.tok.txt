this film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema .
by seeing this film , we can only retrospectively notice that world cinema in 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy , such a strong and adequate use of sound-image montage , and almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life .
cinema was then not only one form of arts .
it was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war .
it is said , that even picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years !
audience that time was also different .
i read that after seeing kurosawa 's `` ikiru ( live ) '' in its first release , young couple quietly told each other , '' it is a good film , is n't it ? ''
.
i think , contemporary cinema , though technically developed and opened some new narrative perspective , has lost the most important -- -reliance of audience.cienma was once really the most popular art from and , unlike modern fine arts and contemporary music , gave millions of people hope and ideals .
in this point of view , '' letyat zhuravli '' must be in the pantheon of classics of all the time , as `` city light '' , '' ikiru '' and `` la strada '' .
