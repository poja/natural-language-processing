`` the dresser '' is a small but absolutely wonderful film , brilliantly acted by albert finney and tom courtenay .
how in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major academy award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me , but it 's nice to know the academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while ( of course , they gave the award that year to `` terms of endearment '' -- after all , they do n't want to be accused of showing too much taste ) .albert finney is a drunken shakespearean actor in a production of `` king lear '' ; tom courtenay is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights .
it 's both hilarious and piteous to see courtenay 's character showering finney 's with attention and affection , only to see his efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed , even up to the very bitter end .
finney and courtenay work wonders together , and though finney gets the showiest moments ( he does get to recite shakespeare after all ) , courtenay is the heart and soul of the film.grade : a
