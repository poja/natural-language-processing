anne ( natalie portman ) tells us about how much she hates her mother , adele ( susane sarandon ) .
that 's how the movie begins .
adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to california without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason .
the story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter .
it 's really deep and touching , thanks to the great work of the actresses .
natalie was nominated to a golden globe for that role .
she is one of the most talented actresses i ever saw , and so is sarandon .
they really look like mother daughter .
the soundtrack is also great .
the movie is incredible .
