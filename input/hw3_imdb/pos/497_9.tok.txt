i loved it .
in fact , i watched it over and over and over , and i could watch it again .
this movie does n't get boring.the vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie .
it 's a job well done , great for today 's generation.wesley snipes was born for this role .
stephen dorff was an ideal vampire .
arly jover , mmmm mmm , she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has .
donal logue provides great comical relief.this vampire movie is like no other .
i ca n't wait for blade 2 .
