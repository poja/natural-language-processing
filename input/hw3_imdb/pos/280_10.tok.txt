at the beginning of this film , which i found myself watching on ifc in the wee hours of the morning , i was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort .
the feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that i did n't know if i wanted to continue watching ... although it did n't really seem to me that i had much of a choice , so compelling was the situation.gradually , though , that feeling of discomfort waned ( although it never really disappeared entirely ) , and i felt drawn into tessa & bobby 's predicaments , and really just hoping against hope that they might get back together.really just a moving , powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package .
i had no idea that sarah polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia , so now i love it even more.i definitely recommend it .
... if your lucky enough to catch it on the independent film channel sometime , or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it .
