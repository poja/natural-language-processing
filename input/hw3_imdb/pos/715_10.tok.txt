i watched the this the other night on a local station because i did n't feel like watching tripe like 'american idol ' .
peter strauss gives a great performance as a convict named 'rain ' murphy who keeps to himself .
he admits to his crime and makes no bones that he feels no shame for it .
his cell is bare of any comforts that other inmates have like books and pictures .
the only time he feels in another zone is in running .
he does it often and can run a mile in under four minutes .
when a college coach hears about this , he wants to prime him for a shot at the olympics .
at first , 'rain ' wants no part of this , but when his best friend is killed , he shows interest.this is a good movie , period .
strauss is very good ( what did you expect , anything less ? )
and michael mann shows hints of greatness that would come full bloom years later .
this movie had that bit of realism ( probably because it was filmed among convicts ) .
it almost feels like this was a true story .
the additional casting is good .
there is a lot of notable names like brian dennehy , roger e. mosley , and richard moll as well.my heart sank when some pompous board of directors would n't let him run because he did n't feel bad for his crime .
his final act made me stand up and cheer .
when they took his dreams away , he took them back hard .
this was back when tv movies were actually good .
'the jericho mile ' is a gem of a film .
espn classic , please show this film !
