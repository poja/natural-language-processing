lackawanna blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy .
the film clearly supports `` it takes a village to raise a child '' and reminds of an important time in black history and culture .
i gained an incredible amount of respect for macy gray as an actress .
her character was a little crazy , yet lovable ; clearly we all have known someone like macy 's character .
s. epatha merkerson is absolutely fantastic as nanny .
i never realized that epatha was such a great actress .
law & order never showcased the depth of epatha 's acting abilities like lackawanna blues .
i was pleasantly surprised and amazed !
the music and the characters reminded me of my own childhood ... it was a sweet nostalgic walk down memory lane .
i truly enjoyed the film and eagerly await the dvd release to add to my collection .
