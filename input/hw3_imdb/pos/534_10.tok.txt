being 15 myself i enjoyed this flick thouroughly !
!
i related to the character ann august more than most would .
my mother isnt as eccentric as adele , but the feelings of lonliness is the same .
this movie is perfect in the ating aspects , and natalie 's , and susan 's performances are so linked together that it 's the best onscreen dual i have seen in years .
their chemistry brings the characters to life , they become real people !
i would recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to get away .
because there is genually alot of people out there who would wish to be `` anywhere but here '' including me !
and if you can , see this movie with your best friend or your mother .
its the tears that blend everyone around you together more !
