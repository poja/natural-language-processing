ok i am a huge traci fan so her just being in the movie automatically makes it rank at the 8.5+ rating .
but even besides her being in it i thought it was a good movie especially for it being an hbo movie .
but i am afraid if you take traci out of the movie it would just be ok. but a person ca n't do that she is in it and she is a wonderful actress .
she just keeps getting better and better .
