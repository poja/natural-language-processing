the plot is somewhat original , and all the actors did their job pretty well .
there is a plenty of comic relief , too .
some things do not make a lot of sense ( e.g .
the first `` chase '' scene , why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave ? )
.
the russians actually speak russian without accent , but the cars are extremely strange , with models spanning like 50 years , and so the place seems weirdly out of time .
overall , if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well .
