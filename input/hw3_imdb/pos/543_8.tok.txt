chick flick ?
of course ... .
been done before ?
many times ... .
predictable ?
yes ... .. worth watching ?
you bet !
i was delighted with sarandon and portman 's portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line .
i am a great fan of mother/daughter stories .
what makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones are the performances and the character development .
although this is not the best of its genre , i will buy it and watch it again .
i felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior .
