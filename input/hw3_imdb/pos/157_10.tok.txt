i wo n't bore you with any synopsis , chances are you already know them .
and hopefully you are already familiar with park chan-wook 's work.i strongly disagree with some of the other commentators in saying that `` park has not moved on from the vengeance trilogy blah blah blah . ''
because you know what ?
he has !
!
!
the vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with , how can you even compare the sombreness and subtlety of `` sympathy for mr vengeance '' with the frantic and extravagance of `` oldboy '' ?
park chan-wook has incredible style , but his movies do n't all share the same style !
that has been true and remains true with the release of `` thirst '' .
`` thirst '' is an incredible picture , it literally has everything you want in a movie .
jaw-dropping violence , tasteful gore , great humour , incredible suspense and even very realistic sex scenes .
the story is so crazy that at no point can you guess what will happen next .
i 'm so happy to say that park is back in top form with this fantastic dark-comic-vampire-love-story .
watch it as soon as you can !
