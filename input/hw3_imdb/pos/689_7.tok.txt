***************************mild spoilers ahead**************************we dive at dawn is an english made movie with john mills in the lead role .
the second time i watched the dvd version was on a big screen tv and i must say the movie is better than i thought the first time i saw it on the samll screen .
may be it was the big screen viewing that helped ?
i still say the first few segments of the movie are muddled , but once the submarine leaves the dock and begins its mission , the movie takes off too !
the search for the german battleship named the brandenburg and the adventures which went along with it were absorbing and the detail shown in the movie are interesting !
i 'm increasing my rating to 7/10 .
if you enjoy ww ii films , i think you 'll find this one interesting once the submarine gets underway .
some of the men on the sub have quite a sense of humor , too !
