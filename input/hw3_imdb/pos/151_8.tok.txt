korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head , and the latest by the celebrated director chan-wook park is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire .
add a temptress leading him astray and a cast of eccentrics and you have a wonderful recipe.directed in part in a style similar to the `` sympathy '' trilogy it 's as sumptuous as it is dark .
steering clear of clich√© it does offer some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre .
its an existential movie trying to capture the moral conundrum of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the blood lust .
however , the film does n't take itself too seriously and there is boundless humour throughout.our leads play their roles to perfection , playing with our emotions and revelling in the dark humour .
there are moments of reflection on the whole moral conundrums involved in the film but its never preachy .
some might find it overlong and it can lull at points but it 's worth giving it a chance to the end.if you like left field films then there are fewer better than this one of late .
dark and engrossing , it will pull in a crowd .
one i 'd recommend you give a try .
