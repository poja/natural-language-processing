it 's just one of those films , you 're either love it or hate it , my girlfriend and me loved it , told my brother to rent it and he hated it , said it was too flashy and colloquial , then again he only usually goes to see big action movies , so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed .
there were some great new talent ( i 'd never heard of the leads before anyway ) ?
des brady ( the directors brother ? )
was especially good .
playing a right dick at the start i thought he never would redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and by the end i was really routing for him .
a very surprising film with a whole lot of heart , if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original .
