well , i 've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it 's still almost as interesting as when i first saw it .
it is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.i still think martin sheen got `` dissed '' big-time in the billing , too .
he dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than marlon brando , who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours , 17 minutes film ( theatrical version ) .
how unfair is that ?
sheen is fantastic in here , especially his narration , which runs throughout .
it 's one of the best narrations , if not the best , i have ever heard in a movie .
his voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible , nightmare-like adventure .
i never fail to appreciate his work in this movie.the other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes , ones i have never forgotten , such as ... ... sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movie 's first scene ; robert duvall and the totally out-of-place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with wagner 's dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters ; the playboy bunny entertaining the troops ; frederic forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle ; the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride ; the appearance of hippie journalist dennis hopper greeting the crew in cambodia and then brando 's bizarre character .
it goes on and on with strange scenes.that 's not to say i enjoyed everything .
no , there are a few very unpleasant scenes , such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half ( ca n't watch that anymore ) , an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by sheen 's young stoned-out crew , and the crew is a little too goofy at times .
then , there is the huge amount of profanity , led by way too many f-words.so , there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this one thing for sure : it is a film you will remember !
