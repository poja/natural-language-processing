although it was dark , depressing , and at times hard to watch , you are alone held my attention and was refreshingly honest in its dialog .
it truly captured the angst of teenage romantic relationships .
in addition , the soundtrack was amazing .
the lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie .
jessica bohl is the best actress i have ever watched .
her compelling and believable performance made the movie .
it made me wonder if she really is a prostitute .
who knows .
anyway , the movie was very worth seeing .
love , your sister !
yeah , that 's right ... .
