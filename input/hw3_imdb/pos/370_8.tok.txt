in my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime , i stumbled upon this film on cable .
i tried hitchcock three times before this , and never have i felt that the man 's work lived up to the praise he had received .
i always felt he was good , not great ( from what i 've seen ) this was the best of his films i 've seen thusfar .
robert walker is absolutely chilling , his performance takes the film where hitchcock wanted it to go .
even an average performance here damages the overall product .
my favorite scene was his obsession about getting the lighter from the drain ( how exactly does he get his arm down there though ? )
bruno is quite a compelling character , but i also loved the performance by patricia hitchcock as barbara .
the rest of the morton family as well as guy were a bit dry and boring , but she added some flare to the movie , as well as having some of the better lines in the script.lastly , in any suspense movie , you 're going to live and die by your ending .
this one holds water , unlike a couple other hitchcock films i 've seen .
i truly was unsure of how it would end , which kept me on the edge while i watched and waited .
