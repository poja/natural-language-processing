this is n't a life-changing movie ; it 's not an epic , or anything like that .
but it 's entertaining , and it 's fun .
it 's a film that the whole family can watch together , and at the moment there are precious few kid-suitable films that do n't have a love story in them !
it tells a good story in a lighthearted way without trying to dazzle the audience with over-the-top special effects , like lots of films these days are .
it 's got some fairly good acting in , and all the music that 's been used fits in pretty well with the movie content .
the acting is quite good too , the actors look comfortable and believable in their surroundings and most importantly the jokes are actually funny .
i 'd recommend it for people of all ages - it certainly made me laugh .
