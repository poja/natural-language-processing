this movie is all about reality , submarine warfare in ww2 was not a clean precise science .
there were no computers giving exact enemy details , there was no precise instrumentation to 100 % control the sub .
not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart , and a smile on their dial.people with expectations of seeing a `` pretty war '' in this movie will be grossly disappointed , ... ... ... ... .. good , they deserve to be disappointed , they deserve to have reality shoved into their face.war is not clean , exact , fought by people about to break into song .
it is endured by scared , cold/burnt , hungry , desperate people willing to do anything to survive .
`` we dive at dawn '' is a fine example portraying a desperate situation needing desperate actions .
