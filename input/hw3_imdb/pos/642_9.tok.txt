an amazing piece of film that was well-conceived and kept me on the edge of my seat .
brilliantly orchestrated in its timing , and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release .
the acting was generally well-done ( the `` director '' should 've asked alec guinness for acting lessons ) , and the shot selections were impressive ( as in elongating the hall as billy tries to race to the door in the studio ) .
this movie did n't let up since the opening scene ...
