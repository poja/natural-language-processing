the jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie .
the only sci-fi part is the woolly mammoths living in the present day.elephants are attacking villages in a part of india and these attacks are also killing people .
an expedition is sent to investigate and one of the members of this , an american hunter blames these elephants are being frightened by woolly mammoths , which are suppose to be extinct .
nobody believes him at first , but they do when the mammoths appear at the end .
an earthquake finishes them off.the jungle was shot on location in india and has a lot of nice scenery and some good indian music , including some songs which keep the movie moving along nicely .
the mammoths are actually real elephants with fur coats and long tusks stuck on.the cast includes rod cameron , cesar romero ( the lost continent ) and marie windsor ( cat-women of the moon ) .the jungle is worth seeing , just for the scenery and music .
very enjoyable.rating : 3 stars out of 5 .
