in the early '80s , i recorded honky tonk freeway from the cable .
since then i have waited , hoping it would be on dvd .
yesterday i found it .
it is one of the best humorous character studies i ever saw .
the old fashioned episode is priceless .
at this time ( 4/28/02 ) only two have reviewed it .
one hated it , the other loved it .
if you have a dvd player , either rent it , or buy it as i did .
