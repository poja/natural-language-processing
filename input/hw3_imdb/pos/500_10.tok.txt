this is one of those movies that i can watch again and again and not get tired of it .
it is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever .
i liked this one even more than x-men .
in fact , this movie is sort of a cross between x-men and the matrix and it came out before either .
wesley snipes does a great job with the character of blade .
he is just not an emotionless super hero .
also , this movie is n't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating .
sure comic books are for kids mainly , but i like a little more in my movies .
let 's face it , if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic .
this comic book adaptation also has something that many do n't .
a good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy .
let 's face it , none of the batman movies had a very good ending fight .
