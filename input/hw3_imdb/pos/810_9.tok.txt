the hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from agatha christie and of course poirot .
it ' s set on a country house on a weekend .
as always all the guests are suspects and it 's up to poirot to figure out the truth .
with movies like this it 's always best not to give too much away so i 'll stop here .
what i loved in the `hollow ' was that it 's a mystery the old fashioned way .
when poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example .
everybody seems to be the culprit .
there 's that suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for the story.you can expect a wonderful time giving guesses as to whom did it and how and why and maybe in the end even be surprised .
a cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you got a pretty enjoyable experience.the actors are all very good .
as a curiosity notice edward hardwicke who played dr. watson in sherlock holmes .
nice to see him after a few years .
suchet is amazing as always and fortunately is on screen most of the time.i did find out who the murderer was but still it 's not predictable and it 's also very believable.so in conclusion a great movie and as always a pleasure .
