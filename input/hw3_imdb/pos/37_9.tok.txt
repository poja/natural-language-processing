this is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times .
i 'll go so far as to put it up there with ray and the aviator .
it is the story of a young , bi-racial boy who lives in a boarding house run by the amazing miss rachael aka `` nanny '' .
you will fall in love with nanny , a woman who gives all of herself to those around her .
s. epatha merkerson brings the character to life beautifully , and the other cast members are do the same .
if i were to praise each actor for the way they played their roles , i 'd have to mention everyone in the entire cast .
the music in this film perfectly blends with the story , almost dictates the way it goes .
and what 's more , this film is actually entertaining .
it wo n't bore you at all , not even for a minute !
i highly recommend this film to anyone wanting to spend an evening at home watching a very smart , very entertaining , quality film .
