after seeing the harry potter movies , i 've been a fan of the trio actors rupert grint , daniel radcliffe and emma watson ; yet , we 've been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides play the same characters year or every two years of the j.k. rowling series .
mainly instead of a trio , the cameras and magazine articles concentrate more on daniel and emma , being that they 're the leading male and only leading female in the saga leaving rupert dead-end .
no matter , every actor has a time to shine and rupert 's light hits him for once in this movie .
`` driving lessons '' is called the harold and maude of this generation with rupert grint playing the role of ben marshall , a young british lad who lives with his domineering mother ( laura linney ) and a wimp of a vicar ( priest ) father for which he wants a job in the summer but ca n't find work while at the same time taking his driving tests ( and failing ) and writing poetry for a young girl who does n't have any interest in him.ben seeks an ad in a church newspaper for which the job requires to take care of an elderly lady .
he takes the job and realizes that he 's in for a fun of surprises as evie ( julie walters , rupert 's mother in the harry potter series ) an out-of-work actress who is also a poet giving ben the run for his money .
they bond where and tell each other secrets along with evie acting like a child and getting into mischief where she drags ben along for a country road trip .
from their not only does ben drive all the way from britain to scotland since evie needs to recite at a local library , but at the same time an older lady falls for the young man in which ben starts becoming a man.there is mishap and at the same time rejoice with ben and evie along with saying that i was very pleased about the film when it came out in theaters and i was impressed with rupert grint 's acting , especially if he showed the rest of the world that even though he brings a bit of ron weasley within ben marshall , there 's no stopping the actor on his brilliant performance .
