i always felt that ms. merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills .
familiar to millions as the lt. on law and order , she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases , always in a supporting role .
hbo 's lackawanna blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as nanny , successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration .
but the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in lackawanna , new york , a suburb of buffalo.the story could be set in any major african-american community of the 50 's and 60 's from atlanta 's sweet auburn to new york 's harlem .
but the segregation-integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at nanny 's boarding house .
the story revolves around nanny 's relationships with all kinds of people , played by some of the best actors in the business ( i purposely did not say black actors -- this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black , except for jimmy smits , of course ) i recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day .
