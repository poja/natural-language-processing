this movie was made on a relatively small budget ( 10-20 million dollars ? )
with almost no promotion at all from its distributors .
i only knew about it because i am a long time jean-claude van damme fan and i always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys ( derailed , second in command ) , they are .
this movie has an easy enough plot to follow and van damme gives a good , humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving van damme , scott adkins and the final one of them together .
the editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible but isaac florentine can definitely film a good fight scene .
i too am happy that van damme has been acting better lately ( in hell , wake of death , until death ) but with the good acting came less martial arts .
in the shepherd , van damme proves that he still has it .
