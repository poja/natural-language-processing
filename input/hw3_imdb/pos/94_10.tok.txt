this marvelous short will hit home with everyone who , as a child , specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool , only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your mom or dad ( or both ) that it did n't matter , as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a witness protection program in order to avoid ridicule .
for those u.s. residents who do n't get the horror because you do n't follow hockey , it 's like a dallas cowboy fan getting a washington redskins jersey or a yankees fan getting a red sox jersey .
it is n't pretty .
for our european friends , think of two great rival football ( soccer to us ) clubs and imagine a fan of one getting a jersey from the other .
ouch !
