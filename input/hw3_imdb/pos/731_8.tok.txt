as a late-going patron of the drive-in thearers ( 1970's-1980s ) , there are many movies that i have seen & forgotten .
this is one i could never forget .
despite its low-budget , exploitation-style of movie-making , the story was very well done .
the isolated therapy-asylum , where patients act out their fantasies in order to help cure their phsycosis , the accidental murder of the head doctor just as the new nurse arrives on the scene , the ( supposed ) assistant doctor taking over , the various crazy paitents , the revelation that the assistant doctor is actually a patient herself , and , finally , the rescue of the young nurse by the simple-minded sam , who killed everyone else in the house so she could escape unharmed , made for a great story , which held the film together .
i emphasised the word story because that 's what makes a good or great film .
no matter how much blood , gore , nudity , sexual matter , or outrageous behaviour you put in a film , if the story is not good , then the film is not good .
the film credits show clips of all the actors , including the old hag with the final line telling you to get out & never come back , which is a great ending to this film .
if it is out on video/dvd , see it & enjoy it .
