i have watch this movie almost every night that is was on hbo .
it is of my opinion that it could have been successful in the theater , providing the advertisement leading up to it was top scale .
i was thoroughly impressed with the actress who played nanny .
she is an outstanding actress .
of course , my favorite actor is terrance howard .
he is a very understated actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received .
ebony magazine did do a nice article on him , giving him some of his due propers .
lakawanna blue , gave me a understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us .
they were from a similar town `` philadelphia , pa '' were they had to have their fun in the junt joints and such .
i also like to say that mos def is a incredible actor .
he has found his calling .
i 've seen him in several movies where he has played a variety of roles , from thug to doctor and he has the stuff !
overall , please put lakawanna blues on video for rental .
