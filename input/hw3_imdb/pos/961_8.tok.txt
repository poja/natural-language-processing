who said it had to be believable ?
do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film .
you 'll enjoy the experience much more .
you 'll find yourself forgiving some of the movie 's more outlandish plot set-ups , and simply accepting it for what it is -- a great family film .
i appreciated not having to be concerned about `` questionable elements '' in a children 's film for once .
that , to me , is worth the price of the ticket .
and it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about it -- older chidlren will enjoy this film .
enough good humor to keep adults interested .
very good film .
