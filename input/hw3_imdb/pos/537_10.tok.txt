most families will recognise similarities between their own family and that created through brilliant acting by natalie portman and susan sarandon .
natalie creates an on screen image that justifies her as one of the best actresses in america and one worthy of a golden globe nomination .
the control of her emotions are so in tact that at any point in the movie she can tap into them and release an unforgettable scene .
susan is also amazing in this movie as yet again she chose a role that is so different to any other and carries it through with true professionalism.any natalie fan would 've seen the film based on her past successes , but you should also see it for the emotions that are released during the film .
it is a truly humbling experience .
