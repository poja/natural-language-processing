the first murder scene is one of the best murders in film history ( almost as good as the shower scene in psycho ) and the acting by robert walker is fantastic.a psychopath involved with tennis star in exchange murders.that´s the story and overall this film is very good but theres one problem : why dosen´t guy haines go to the cop in the first place.4/5
