there 's a spartan , unsentimental edge to this film that allows plenty of room for us to participate in the action without any stylistic encumbrance telling us how we 're meant to be feeling ; in 'blue ' , everything was overtly sad ( sure , powerful as hell , but still ) ; in 'white ' , it was delightful whimsy .
but there are no such emotional clues , or cues for that matter , in this one .
it 's as if he finally let the force of the tale work its own magic without razzle-dazzle embelishment .
i think that 's what makes it the most initially enigmatic of the three , but finally , the most transcendent and redemptive .
never has remorseless , unsparing honesty been quite so beautiful .
