spawned by the same monty berman / dennis spooner partnership which produced the champions and randall & hopkirk ( deceased ) - the latter retitled my partner the ghost for the us market - department s remains a classic example of the action-adventure series which the uk produced in bulk during the late 1960s .
like those two shows , its internal dynamic of two guys and a girl might seem to indicate a progressive attitude towards equality ( dept s also has a black superior ) , but it 's mostly facade : the launch episode , `` six days '' , is barely halfway through before rosemary nichols is called upon to parade around in bra , panties and one ( yes , one ) stocking in order to extricate herself from a dodgy situation .
still , it 's an interesting time capsule , even if the appalling fashion sense of peter wyngarde 's character ( which , amazingly , degenerated even further in the spin-off series jason king ) should definitely have remained buried .
