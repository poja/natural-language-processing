i love this show .
it 's clever and very well acted .
david morse and andre braugher have great chemistry .
the writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief .
after every new episode , i 'm always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is .
my only complaint would be donna murphy 's absence , at this point , in the second season .
as david morse ex-wife , heather , she added such character to the show.i think this show is a credit to the crime/drama genre .
with that said - i can not for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating .
would someone please who gave this show a 1 rating back it up with a critique ?
