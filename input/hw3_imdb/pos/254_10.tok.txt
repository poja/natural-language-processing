i just re-watched 08th ms gundam for the 2nd time .
it is so much better than gundam wing .
i ca n't wait to get the dvd and see what was edited out of the series .
this is great to see the gundams actually move about clumsily through the land .
somebody really thought over writing this move script.see this today , .
