this was absolutely one of the best movies i 've seen .
excellent performances from a marvelous a-list cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back.i could n't help but care about the characters .
ms. merkerson will blow you away , as will the young man playing the young lead.i also thought that the set design was top-rate .
the viewer is really placed inside each era as it 's presented .
the music is a blast , too .
nice selections to represent mood , time and place .
the blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs .
this is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings .
take the time to watch it !
