i just discovered this obscure '70s horror movie while browsing on youtube .
for a low-budget effort , it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish .
while there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly , the fact that she 's a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story and there 's one scene with the curly-haired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad .
the young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself and i 'm not surprised she posed for the cover of playboy .
some characters are very irritating and some scenes do seem ridiculous .
for the most part , however , do n't look in the basement ( that 's the title i saw on youtube ) provides enough drama and chills for an entertaining b-movie .
