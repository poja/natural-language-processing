she did not keep falling deep into the paradise lost , but decided to leave human alone .
fragile , but lovely femme fatale !
this movie made me think about suffering between human and vampire , that far beyond priest , and salvation .
also i thought about love .
adam was not so responsible for eve 's but this adam ( priest ) , sacrificial and responsible to pick eve up from the paradise lost , vampire 's world .
another symphonic poem of adam & eve , paradise lost .
