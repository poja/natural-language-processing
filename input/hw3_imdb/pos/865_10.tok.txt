if you were ever a fan of mtv '' s `` the state , '' then these three guys will be familiar to you .
but even if you only stumbled upon them via the internet like i did , you will soon come to appreciate their unique brand of comedy.born out of their stand up comedy trio , 'stella ' , michael ian black , michael showalter and david wain produced these brilliant vignettes of surreal comedy to display at their shows , and now after being available only to download from two websites , they appear in pristine glory on one dvd.think comedy sketch show sans censorship , and you 'd be halfway there .
no stone of decency is left unturned .
but for those who like their comedy rude , self-indulgent and bordering on puerile , ( and i mean that in the most flattering way ) this is the dvd for you !
i think it 's worth the money for the commentary from the two michaels and david alone , you ca n't help but take a liking to them as they explain their actions , cringe at their own antics with sex toys and by turn pat each other on the back and hurl abuse.fantastic.it must say something for the appeal of stella that the likes of julie bowen and paul rudd are willing to throw themselves into the action so fearlessly .
and you should follow their fine example , throw preconceptions to the wind , and prepare to laugh yourself sick .
