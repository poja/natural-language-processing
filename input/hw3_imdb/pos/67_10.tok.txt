this blake edwards film is n't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy , a drama or a musical .
no matter , the sheer presence of julie andrews , is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof .
julie is beautiful and uses her many talents , throughout the film .
rock hudson looks tired , but he 's is more than fine , as julie 's romantic interest .
authentic world war i cars and planes , add to the appeal .
overall , the film is very entertaining .
the dvd release is an edited ( by blake edwards ) version of the original release .
supposedly , this is the only version that edwards would allow ; but , turner classic movies has shown the complete ( theatrical release ) version , recently .
recommended .
