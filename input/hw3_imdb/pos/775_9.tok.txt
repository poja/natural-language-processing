i watched this film on itv and i enjoyed it a lot .
it was very watchable and very funny .
julie walters and rupert grint were perfect in their roles .
julie walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch .
ben 's character is kinda shy and stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by rupert grint , i would definitely say he has a future in acting after harry potter.laura linney is quite good in her role as ben 's over protective mother , the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too ... .villain-y .
ben 's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother , and in the end he is quite honourable too .
the only character i was n't keen on was bryony , she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thought.overall this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch .
one of my favourite films of the year easily .
