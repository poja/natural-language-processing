i 'm not a big fan of musicals , but i was always enamored of ms. hayworth 's looks , so i thought i 'd give it a try.this may be the best showcase for the multi-talented ms. hayworth .
she 's never looked lovelier in a film ( with the possible exception of 'gilda ' , where she is sex symbol par excellence ) .rita is more than ably assisted by gene kelly and phil silvers .
the comedy may be dated , but it is still quite amusing .
kelly does one of his tour-de-force dances , dancing with the image of himself from a window.but rita drives this whole movie .
an excellent cast , featuring otto kruger and the always- wonderful , wise-cracking eve arden does n't hurt.rita sings , rita dances , all the while looking impossibly beautiful !
the music may be short of classic , but the lyrics to most of the tunes are quite clever.i find this movie works better than 'gilda ' , which i regard as a flawed film .
to ms. hayworth 's credit , she also drives 'gilda ' , and gilda drives any red-blooded male insane.the film holds up well after all these years .
much leg candy for the male audience is a nice bonus !
