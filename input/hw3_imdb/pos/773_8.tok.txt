sweet , entertaining tale of a young 17 1/2 year old boy , controlled by by an overbearing religious mother and withdrawn father , and how he finds himself through his work with a retired , eccentric and tragic actress .
very well acted , especially by julie walters .
rupert grint plays the role of the teenage boy well , showing his talent will last longer than the harry potter series of films .
laura linney plays his ruthlessly strict mother without a hint of redemption , so there 's no room to like her at all .
but the film is a very entertaining film , made well by the british in the style of the likes of keeping mum and calendar girls .
