this was a bold movie to hit indian cinemas when it was released .
the first movie to perhaps openly depict lesbian tendencies amongst indian women .
the leading actress of indian cinema shabana azmi added substance to the movie with her hot passionate scenes with nandita das.the movie oozed with sexuality and the director used sex in the best way possible .
the sex was not for erotic purposes but was in the context of the movie .
the scene where nandita das loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in indian cinemas.good acting by all the actors especially nandita das amidst criticism from the indian public
