i 'm out of words to describe the beauty of `` the cranes are flying '' , but i 'll try anyway to write about it .
it 's a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in the second world war .
it 's the classic story of lovers ( boris & veronika ) separated by the war and of what comes between them .
the film 's images are so gorgeous , that you 'll be carried away - the film technique is in perfect unison with the emotion.there are few scenes that portray directly the war : a bombing - wind , lightnings , explosions - that will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist , veronika , who waits for the return of boris ; and there 's another scene on the front , where we we will be confronted by a emotional/visual hurricane showing the images played in boris ' mind .
another scene works as the leitmotif of the film and provides its title - the cranes flying in the sky .
this image stands as a the symbol for nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film : not to give up hope and fight for a better future.kalatozov is a great director , this film is visually stunning and it also touched me deeply .
it is not just pure technique .
tatyana samojlova is perfect as veronika .
what more can i say ?
the film transcends the time it was made - the action takes place during the second world war .
but it could have happened anytime , anywhere .
as long there are wars ( great or small ) the film and its message will remain relevant .
