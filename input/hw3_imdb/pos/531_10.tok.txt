i just came back from seeing this awesome movie !
!
i can relate to it so much ... it reminded me when my sister had to go to college , we had to move from place to place , and my mom acts like adele august !
boys might not like this movie since it brings tears to your eyes .
one of the best real-life movies i 've ever seen !
!
and natalie portman rules !
