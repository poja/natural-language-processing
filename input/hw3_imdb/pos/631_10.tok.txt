one of my all-time favourite movies .
nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time .
if i could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia i would so i could enjoy this movie as much as i did that very first time .
it 's still enjoyable second and third times round but i found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills were n't unexpected .
if you want a see a film that you truly wo n't be able to predict the ending of then i highly recommend this film .
its chilling , shocking , full of suspense and there 's also loads of humour to help you through it too .
if you watch this film and do n't love it i truly question your sanity !
