this movie made by the nfbc was made in honor of the montreal canadians dynasty years in the 50's,60 's and 70 's .
my 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. i have been a canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life .
on a scale of 1-10 , i give this film a 117. all hockey fans should see this as i hope it will be placed in the hockey hall of fame in toronto and shown at the bell centre in montreal or here in edmonton at rexall place .
watch this film with your family it is a great movie .
i also recommend the book in both french and english .
go habs go .
