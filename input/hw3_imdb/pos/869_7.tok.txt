a very interesting plot of the film based on the novel `` waltz into darkness '' of the writer cornell woolrich .
it is a drama rather than a film noir , which tries to send a message that love changes your own life , i.e .
your love to any person and the love you received from him/her .
a wealthy man really changed his life for love , while his partner finally understood that he was the only one that loved her .
belmondo played well as usual , while a somewhat still young michel bouquet played his eternal role of a detective or police agent .
frankly bouquet was not so impressive in this film , but less than that was the performance of catherine deneuve .
she was not so convincingly in her role as a prostitute then lover/wife of louis mah√© ( belmondo ) .
for those who like to visit the world , the film offers the occasion to see part of the ascension island , and also lyon city in france .
