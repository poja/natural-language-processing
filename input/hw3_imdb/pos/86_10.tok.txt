this movie was everything but boring .
it deals with reality .
to the people who think this movie was boring , open your eyes to the real problems in our society .
our children are dying .
the consequences of alcohol and drug abuse are not to be ignored .
i work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency counselor , and i deal with these problems every day .
people of all ages and all walks of life are effected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse .
it destroys families , hurts people and leads to serious brain damage , all kinds of health problems , and death .
it is all preventable .
this movie should be shown in every high-school in the world .
