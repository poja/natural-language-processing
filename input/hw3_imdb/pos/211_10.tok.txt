having long disdained network television programming , i remember the first time i caught an episode of `` police squad ! ''
.
it was totally by accident .
it was during the show 's initial network run on abc in early 1982. i am a chronic channel surfer and was flipping the dial one evening when suddenly appeared `` police squad !
`` 's opening credit sequence on my tv screen .
i immediately recognized it as a sendup of the opening credits of `` m-squad '' starring lee marvin , one of my all-time favorite cop shows .
i stopped surfing .
then of course came headquarters getting shot up , followed by the immortal rex hamilton as abraham lincoln .
by now i was saying to myself `` what the heck is this ?
? ''
.
then came `` special guest star '' georg stanford brown getting flattened by a plummeting safe .
i was hooked from that moment .
the episode was `` ring of fear/a dangerous assignment '' , with its comic references to `` on the waterfront '' , and `` muhammed ali '' , but most memorable of course were all the sight gags and non sequiturs .
leslie nielsen and alan north in their loose parody of lee marvin and paul newlan of `` m squad '' were an absolute riot .
`` finally '' , i said to myself , `` a network television program truly worth watching !
!
! ''
.
would n't you know it would be canceled just a few weeks later .
leave it to the networks -- i should have known .
anyway , i just bought the dvd collection of all six episodes and they are just as funny today as they were 27 years ago .
the `` naked gun '' movies were terrific as well , but i really missed alan north ( he was so good as ed hocken ) , peter lupus as nordberg ( what were they thinking casting oj in that part ? )
, and especially william duell 's `` johnny '' the shoeshine guy .
great stuff .
