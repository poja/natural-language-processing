having been raised in canada , i saw this short many times mostly on the cbc .
i have seen it numerous times , at many ages in my life , and each time the reactions are the same .
it is a joyous bittersweet , beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart .
i am sure i have it on some vhs tape somewhere digging around.every kid growing up can relate to the situation , and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols .
the scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the eatons catalogue and his jumping around the room is priceless .
i have n't seen someone capture that carefree mood of youth on film as well as this little short has.sure i am a montreal habs fan , and that makes my appreciation for it more special .
but in the end it is the nostalgic look and feel of pond hockey , and the memories of your family telling you that you should be greatful for what you get even if it is n't exactly what you wanted .
and oh yeah , the animation is beautiful too ; ) rating 10 out of 10
