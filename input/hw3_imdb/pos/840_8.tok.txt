many consider beast stable to be the last of the `` true '' female prisoner films , as it is the last of the series directed by shunya ito , and is followed by one other film ( grudge song ) by a different director .
i have not seen grudge song yet ( but soon will ... ) so i do n't know how it stacks up to the previous fp films - but it will be interesting to see .
the way beast stable ended did n't really leave a lot of room for another predecessor - but i guess i 'll find out ... this entry has scorpion on the run from the cops , where she hooks up with a street-hooker who ends up pregnant with her retarded brothers child ( oh yeah - that 's no lie ... got ta love these sleazy story lines ) .
scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old rival , but ( as she is so good at ... ) ends up escaping and taking revenge on some people that wronged a few of her hooker friends ... i agree with some other reviewers , that this one is a little slower at points and more `` serious '' then the previous two entries .
the story is somewhat confusing and convoluted at times , but a lot of these 70 's era pinky films are - and i still love them .
beast stable is lacking pretty badly in the nudity area which was pretty disappointing - but i thought it strong in other areas - storyline , cinematography , some good sleaze , etc ... definitely worthwhile to fans of this sort of thing , or who have enjoyed the other female prisoner films ... 8/10
