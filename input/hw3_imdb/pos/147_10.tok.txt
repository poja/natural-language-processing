of the korean movies i 've seen , only three had really stuck with me .
the first is the excellent horror a tale of two sisters .
the second and third - and now fourth too - have all been park chan wook 's movies , namely oldboy , sympathy for lady vengeance ) , and now thirst .
park kinda reminds me of quentin tarantino with his irreverence towards convention .
all his movies are shocking , but not in a gratuitous sense .
it 's more like he shows us what we do n't expect to see - typically situations that go radically against society 's morals , like incest or a libidinous , blood-sucking , yet devout priest .
he 's also quite artistically-inclined with regards to cinematography , and his movies are among the more gorgeous that i 've seen.thirst is all that - being about said priest and the repressed , conscience-less woman he falls for - and more .
it 's horror , drama , and even comedy , as park disarms his audience with many inappropriate yet humorous situations .
as such , this might be his best work for me yet , since his other two movies that i 've seen were lacking the humor element that would 've made them more palatable for repeat viewings .
