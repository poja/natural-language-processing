its my favourite film because there 's so much going on that you do n't see at first and so many things that make you wonder `` did kieslowski mean that or is it in my head ? ''
for instance - is the judge meant to be god or some supreme being ?
also irene jacob as in the double life of veronique is outstanding , there may be a few superficially prettier actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she does.tritingnant also is magnificent without really saying much and the things he does say are excellent such as his answer to valentine .
