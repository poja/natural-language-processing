this was a excellent movie .
i deal with a child who i am raising that has fae and watching this movie was more than word can explain .
i also purchased the book and it was great .
i would like to have a copy for my own use and so i can have my son 's teachers watch it also.i would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie , let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where i could purchase it .
thank you , myra i would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with children/adults with special ability 's .
this movie should be shown again on tv .
the team of doctor 's that have been tracking my son would also like to have a copy .
his special ed teacher has also asked me to try to locate a copy that he can have or that he can borrow.thank you
