two years after the success of 'airplane ' , jim abrahams and jerry & david zucker created this brilliant sitcom starring the great leslie nielsen as plain clothed detective 'frank drebin ' .
also in the cast was alan north as 'captain ed hocken ' , ed williams as 'ted olsen ' and william duell as 'johnny the shoe shine boy ' .
'police squad ! '
featured unashamedly corny jokes and clever visual gags playing in the background .
each episode would conclude with a mock freeze frame in which the characters in frame stand completely still .
one of the best 'freeze frame ' sequences saw one of the characters pouring coffee into a cup while standing still , causing the cup to overflow !
guest stars were killed off in the opening titles , one included georg stanford brown being crushed by a falling safe !
despite gaining positive reviews and much critical acclaim , 'squad ! '
only lasted for six episodes before being cancelled .
this did n't mean the end though , five years later the show was transferred to the big screen for the first in the trilogy of the 'naked gun ' films .
