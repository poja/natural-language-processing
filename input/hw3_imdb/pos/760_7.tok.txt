i had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as i was perusing the shelves at a local rental store .
having just watched the latest harry potter installment , i was intrigued by rupert grint and wanted to see more of his work .
reading the description on back about `` an overzealous , evangelical christian do-gooder , '' and identifying as an evangelical christian , myself , i thought , `` oooh this should be interesting . ''
and so it was .
i found mr. brock 's story beautiful in both words and images ; and sadly enough , all too familiar .
the contrast he drew between ben 's parent 's interpretations of what it means to be a christian was a poignant commentary on how christians view themselves and the impact that perception has on those around them .
on the one hand , we have ben 's mom stating , `` whatever happens behind these walls , ben , we 're god 's ambassadors .
we show the world a smiling face . ''
on the other hand is ben 's dad discussing truth in his sermon at the beginning of the film .
at the end of his monologue , he states , `` the more a person parades their christianity for the benefit of others , the less i am inclined to trust the christianity they claim .
god tells us true faith is the freedom to choose truth .
now , how you express that , the way , the manner , the means at your disposal , these things are of no consequence , be you christian or atheist , unless in your heart you are true . ''
if only our churches were full of christians who ascribed to this latter definition of what it means to be a follower of jesus , rather than the former .
what a difference that would make !
as a christian and a psychologist , i would want an imperfect yet authentic faith over a perfectly polished image any day .
what a tragedy Â– to feel like i always need to play a role when , really , i just need to rest in the freedom of being completely who god made me to be .
i think mr. brock provides a refreshing glimpse of what this freedom in christ looks like .
i recommend this film for anyone who desires a fresh look at faith .
