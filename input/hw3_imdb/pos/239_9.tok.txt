one of my favorites non-mgm musicals , it 's a classic !
> rita hayworth is in top form , her beauty leaps out of the screen .
gene kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph .
phil silvers is the perfect second bananas , and eve arden injects this movie with a lot of class .
the structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why , in this era where major broadway shows come from the movies , cover girl has n't been adapted to theatre .
