as others that have commented around the web ... i 'm a 130 pilot in the coast guard .
having said that , and being the skeptic i am , i went expecting the over-the-top cheese factors .
there was some cheese , but all in all , not much.. and the film was pretty accurate.i watched the trailer again today .
after seeing the film yesterday , i 've realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes .
this is n't the case.the movie is truly more character/story driven than action .
the inner struggles both costner and kutcher are dealing with.. kutcher 's is revealed further into than movie than costner 's is.of course , there is a minor love story.. no surprise there .
but for the most part , the movie tells the tale of two lives that come together , and after some time , help each other heal old wounds.as girlie as it sounds , costner and , as much as i try not to like him , kutcher do actually work quite well together and compliment each other very well in the movie.as critics have stated , you 've seen it all before.. top gun , officer and a gentlemen , etc .
but what movie has n't been remade a million times.i can recall only one f word being spoken.. and ca n't really recall any other language.the movie is 2+ hours , and for some , may tend to get a little long towards the end.you 'll laugh , you may cry , but i can honestly say , it was worth the $ 4 i paid.i hope you enjoy the movie .
