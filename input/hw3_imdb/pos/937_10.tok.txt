i feel at a loss , so brilliant is this film .
kieslowski is a writer , a philosopher ; and while an excellent filmmaker , his greatness lies in his writing ; and `` red '' is his paradigm .
this film is a metafictional study of the artist 's judgement in the creation of his fictional world ; of how an artist can attempt to remake life -- even his own -- thru his art , even as he can not escape the knowledge that , no matter how he involves himself in his story , it is still fiction and he is still outside of his remade world , still burdened with its unreality and the reality of the life he has tried to artistically remake .
and magically , all of this is not to the smallest degree at the expense of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and fate and the characters who live out this story , this pre-judged destiny .
if i had to choose , i might nominate this the greatest film ever made .
