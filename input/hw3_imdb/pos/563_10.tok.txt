very good film .
very good documentary.very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted , narcissistic , heartless swines their one eyed parents , community and environment raised them as.i tip my lid to pat mcguinness .
can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or investigation ?
we need his integrity , endurance , intelligence , clarity and spirit fighting the rigged game that is world politics and big business.all the animals come out at night - whores , skunk pussies , buggers , queens , fairies , dopers , junkies , sick , venal .
someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets .
pat mcguinness should be the first drops of that real rain .
the people who control this earth are animals .
they need to be drowned.i 'm just in shock .
walking the night is scary business .
the inhuman howling and cackling is of detectives , in murder on a sunday morning .
in pat mcguinness ' blazing spotlight , they look horribly caught , horribly guilty , and ready for a just and horrible drowning.it is exceptionally satisfying , in a world in which the punters play a rigged game , to see justice done and to see every narcissistic felon drown like the pathetic human rats they are.how does it feel you railroading , abominable , snaky fingers of the law ?
how does it feel to have your rigged prosecution , your rigged confession , your rigged detective work found out for what it really was ?
how does it feel ?
i hope it twists like a knife you miserable , one eyed nothings .
