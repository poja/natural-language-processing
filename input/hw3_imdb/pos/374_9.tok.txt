safer indeed .
hitchcock is cinema 's all time pervert ; however , we all know his perversions are ours as well , so we forgive him .
and we not only forgive him but we applaud his clever way to invite us for an unforgettable train ride.i saw hitch 's 1953 , i confess , a week before this one , and i put both in the same category as part of his trademarks .
these trademarks resided in his genius questioning and pulsing his artistic veins that spills psychological drops of blood on the viewer without leaving stains of guilt , instead very subtle awareness of feeling ashame.the pen is always mightier than the sword and hitch firmly wrote the most arguable questions with his wrist , and then holding firmly with his hands , he held cameras that always reflected peoples thirst for blood ( most humans have ) , otherwise comedy would n't be mostly a tragic thing , and making people laugh would n't be so complex.mixing all dark elements of `` high society '' , with a wealthy psychopath bruno , and an ambitious tennis player wan na be politician , guy , the story is one of the most well constructed and guided by hitch , inspiring many filmmakers , not only with its plot , but with tricky images provoking dark smiles and happy nightmares.barely perfect !
