chan-wook park , you have to hand it to the guy .
in my eyes , he 's not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfying.thirst is , essentially , a vampire tale but one that plays fast and loose with some of the `` rules '' of the subgenre .
kang-ho song plays father sang-hyeon , a man who unselfishly gives himself over to a research program and then unselfishly kind of catches the disease they are trying to cure , dies and comes back .
all thanks to the blood he was transfused with .
being the only one out of five hundred to survive , he becomes quite the celebrity to those who know him and all he wants is to get back to normal .
normal , however , now involves being able to leap great distances without injury , wanting to drink blood and getting severely hot under the collar when rays of sun get on his skin .
it 's not long before he 's living with a rather dysfunctional family unit who knew him in his childhood and while he hides his new , strange lifestyle he finds himself drawn into a complex love triangle , becoming more acceptable of darker thoughts and sliding down a slippery slope that could lead him from man to beast to monster.deftly blending a number of genres , park 's movie felt much fresher and more original to me than let the right one in ( to use a recent example ) and genuinely impressed me with it 's approach to material that could easily have felt as well-worn and rehashed as any number of other vampire movies we 've seen over the years .
it 's a mixture of horror , melodrama and comedy while also pondering ideas such as strength of faith , the power over life and death , the downside of immortality , etc , etc.some people have complained that this genre-blending approach weakens the movie but i personally found that it was a lively , entertaining and always enjoyable movie helped by a great central performance from song as the tortured priest and fantastic turns from a supporting cast with no weak links .
many characters get to move through a range of emotions and all do so with skill and believability , especially the young woman ( played by ok-vin kim ) who becomes the object of the priest 's love , lust and affection.fans of asian cinema ( and park in particular ) and also fans of poe 's `` the tell-tale heart '' ( watch and learn ) should lap this up , it 's yet another classy movie from a man who seems to take everything in his stride and always manages to put out nothing less than solid entertainment.see this if you like : cronos , near dark , dellamorte dellamore aka cemetery man .
