saw this for the first time on uk tv , with good musical accompaniment .
the elevator scene is class , especially when he does the going-down thing in the phone booth , and then fiddles with the floor-indicator .
the jump through the transom is really impressive , and there 's so much more .
apart from all the stuff that 's been mentioned before , there 's the fight with the man who 's been bullying the woman with the dog - it just looks so simple .
the only drawback is the plot - he gets mixed up with dead eye dan , who then escapes but does n't reappear , even when some more gangsters get involved later on .
the scene where it looks like he 's shooting at the fat inspector is funny , but would have been better if dead eye was the one pulling the trigger .
