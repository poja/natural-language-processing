since i am a fan of natalie portman , i had to see the movie .
i enjoyed every minute of it .
it plays out in a very sincere way .
throughout the whole movie at seemed as if natalie was the mother and susan was the mother .
susan 's character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it.i heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving natalie and some-guy ( he 's in outside providence ) but natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed .
and i think that is great .
i think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the film.natalie must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because i have n't seen her in a bad film yet .
so , any movie that has natalie portman will no doubt be seen by me.a good film .
