in brooklyn , the nightclub dancer rusty parker ( rita hayworth ) has a simple but happy life dancing in the mcguire 's , owned by her boyfriend danny ( gene kelly ) .
rusty , danny and genius ( phil silvers ) have a ritual on friday nights : they order oysters in a bar , trying to find a pearl .
the life of rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the vanity magazine .
she is invited to work in a huge theater in broadway , whose owner proposes her .
she loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style , missing the love of danny and her old friends .
'cover girl ' is a delightful romantic comedy , very naive and having magnificent parts , such as the beauty and talented rita hayworth dancing , singing and acting ; gene kelly , specially in two scenes , dancing with himself and with rusty and genius on the street ; the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars .
danny , the character of gene kelly , is almost nasty with his chauvinist behavior .
rita hayworth surprised me with her talent : i found her amazing in 'gilda ' , but she is stunning in 'cover girl ' .
in accordance with the information on the cover of the vhs , 'cover girl ' was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot , giving continuity to the story , instead of just being 'thrown ' in the movie .
my sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent gene kelly festival and they loved 'cover girl ' , therefore i dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations .
my vote is nine.title ( brazil ) : 'modelos ' ( 'models ' )
