if you want to see a brilliant performance of mikado , played to perfection with expert timing and panache , do n't watch this version .
if you want to see a hammy version with eric idle strutting around in 1930 's english gentlemen 's private club society , this is the one to watch .
it 's a lot of fun and a good intro to gilbert and sullivan , but after this , rush out and rent the canadian stratford version .
you 'll see the difference between good and great .
nobody does g & s better than brian mcdonald and the stratford group .
