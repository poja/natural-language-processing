this is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind .
one knows it 's going to about a mute , one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment.well , forget it .
the movie starts with a little black humour , and then gets started .
from then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of moscow .
all right , it must be said : the unexpected twists are expected , and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder .
but this movie does n't let you go.it 's like the old gangster movies , but then without any glamour at all and in russia .
and that 's one of the most important aspects of this movie : it 's situated in russia .
this does have a great impact on the movie , according to me it makes it better .
everything becomes simple and basic , life is without nonsense .
this could be a great potential for more movies in the future , gangster movies about the russian mafia.it is a beautifull and terrifying movie .
it 's horror , but you ca n't feel but sympathy for the little mute .
one last advice : do n't look this too late in the evening if you want to sleep well .
