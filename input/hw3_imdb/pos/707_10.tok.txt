i read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature .
finally !
!
!
!
!
it 's about time hollywood got their act together .
the big studios always frown at edgy material , with oscar written all over it .
go figure !
!
jericho mile was made ahead of it 's time .
it 's a masterpiece.michael mann , a true visionary , found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence .
peter strauss ' emmy award performance is probably the best character role i 've seen in my film-viewing lifetime .
any actor who touches this role will never be the same ( unless an academy award is already sitting on their mantle ) .the gritty multi ethnic ensemble , a backdrop for the jericho mile makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world .
this is about redemption without public validation , and the power of the human spirit overcoming all barriers .
imagine a convict imprisoned since he was a teenager for life with no chance of parole , that does n't know he is possibly the fastest runner in the world .
... what would you do ?
?
this movie makes you walk away feeling you have n't been cheated on any level .
totally thrilling , engaging , emotional , and a `` rolling stones '' soundtrack that kick 's ass !
!
!
i always thought this would be made for the big screen ... ca n't wait ... !
!
!
in the meantime i 'll have to continue re-watching my weathered vhs copy i 've had for many years .
