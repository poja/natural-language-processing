this one is a hilarious diamond in the rough .
the acting and plot are n't that impressive , but the lines just keep on coming .
this catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like , well , a bad movie , but it 's so kooky that you ca n't help but be amused .
the spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going ... i was especially fond of sharon , the canuck on shrooms eh ?
however , the one that really stole the show was richard 's little brother andrew ( ira heiden ) , his high pitched whining was somehow endearing .
the whole movie rocked .
