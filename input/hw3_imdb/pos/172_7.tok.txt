this movie is not the scariest of all time , but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick -- low budget , no stars , lots of inventive death scenes , and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats .
the premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well .
a nice starting point for `` just say '' julie brown exposing her talents early in her career .
this film wo n't be seen by many , but for fans of 80 's horror it 's a must .
