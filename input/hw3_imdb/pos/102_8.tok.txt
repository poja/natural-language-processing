although bullet in the brain is , without question , superior amongst short films , it largely seems more like a short piece of writing than a film .
and it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot .
but after the bullet enters his brain we begin to understand a little bit about why he became so jaded with life in the first place .
there is an awful amount of detail packed into this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a little bit - it seems like there 's almost too much to take in at once as the details come flying at you so fast .
a slightly more relaxed pace and a less po-faced narrator in the final section would have benefitted this film a little bit .
despite these complaints , there is no denying that bullet in the brain is a quite stupendous work compared to many short , and even full length films .
the makers should be applauded for trying to make such a basically emotional and literate film in the current climate of quick jokes and hollywood action .
