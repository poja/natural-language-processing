three ten-year-old children born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to slyly murder anybody that offends them.while killer kid movies were n't exactly new at the time of this twisted 80 's slasher the theme of children as murderers works nicely for this film .
bloody birthday does deliver some good chills and suspense , while managing to be a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities .
it straddles a fine line between cheesy and creepy , but it does remain entertaining throughout with an interesting plot .
there 's some strong murder scenes , as well as a good bit of nudity to establish this as a solid slasher guilty pleasure.the cast does a fairly good job .
young stars elizabeth hoy and k.c .
martel deliver some menacing performances , while rising star julie brown does a striptease before a memorable murder scene .
veteran star susan strasberg does well as the teacher and jose ferrer has a cameo appearance.all around this off-beat slasher entry is n't bad , though it 's admittedly not flawless , but it is well worth watching for genre fans .
