beware , my lovely came on tv on bbc2 recently during the early hours so i set the video to record it and was pleased i did.a man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he do n't get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widow 's house but she does not know what she is taking on here .
it turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer .
he starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar .
he then cuts the phones line so she ca n't get help from the outside .
a young boy who regularly does shopping for her notices something is n't quite right when he comes to drop her shopping off .
eventually , the man leaves , acting as if nothing has happened.i can see why beware , my lovely was given an x certificate when released in the cinemas .
some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time .
i also thought the man was going to do something to the young boy too.the cast features an excellent performance from robert ryan as the psychopath , ida lupino as the widow and are joined by barbara whiting and dee pollock as the boy.this is certainly robert ryan 's most chilling performance i 've seen .
a must see.rating : 4 stars out of 5 .
