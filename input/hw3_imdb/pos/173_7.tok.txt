an absolute classic of 80 's scare flix .
this one is n't like any other as it pits pint-size , wild-eyed , psychotic youngsters with an urge to kill against all the grown-ups in town .
bud from just one of the guys ( 80 's gold again ) plays one of the killer-kids and he 's paired up with one of the little girls jake blues tries to purchase in the blues brothers .
there is a third blond boy , but he keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason .
the violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly gruesome in spots .
the demonic gang of smiling kids , though somehow possessed by extra-planetary means , bear little resemblance to the droid-ish children of the damned , who never thought to use pistols , crossbows and shovels to kill those pesky adults .
julie brown ( not downtown julie brown-the other one ) shows her rack , like three times , as she dances around in her bedroom .
this movie is a rarity that i can not believe i missed growing up in the 80 's .
this would have been my absolute favorite movie as a kid if i had seen it .
where is the sequel the ending begs for ?
this movie is just incredible .
seek it out at all costs .
