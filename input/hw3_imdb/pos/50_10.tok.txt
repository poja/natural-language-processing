fantastically written , acted , and produced !
loved seeing this gleaming , talented cast -- every single one of them -- give a such great performance .
this movie thoroughly warmed the cockles of my heart !
great storytelling !
this is a great movie for black history month .
full of an accurate portrayal of recent history and very real characters who weathered incredible pain -- with dignity and a belief in a better future .
it is so easy to see how these diverse adults all affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually fuel the talent of his adulthood .
the next time you 're in the company of a listening and observing child , remember ; show or he may be a writer-in-the-making !
