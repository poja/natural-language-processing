i 've seen the beginning of the muppet movie , but just the half .
because i only watched it at mrs kelly 's friend 's house .
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious .
they learn that if they believe in the end of the rainbow , anyone can make it , no matter how small , no matter how green ( which was included in the trailer ) .kermit is my favorite protagonist ( which means it describes the main character ) and so are the other muppets .
mel brooks was amazing when he played professor max krassman .
the scene where miss piggy saves kermit by doing kung fu on those guys .
it was so cool.the muppet movie is the best jim henson film with the most hilarious characters and people will cherish for his successful film .
