randolph scott and glenn ford were once outlaw pals together , but now scott 's a sheriff and young ford is still hiring his gun out .
he gets hired to pull a bank job , but is delayed getting to town and those that hired him get someone else .
that leads to all kinds of complications , a lot for a film that 's not even 90 minutes long.randy and glenn both got girls here .
claire trevor plays her usual good time gal with a heart of gold .
and evelyn keyes is the daughter of edgar buchanan who falls for ford big time without realizing who he is or why he came to the town that scott is the sheriff in.it 's b western , but unusual for the time and for columbia pictures it was given the full technicolor treatment .
the desperadoes marked glenn ford 's first film in technicolor , a process reserved only for some of the more expensive films from bigger studios .
harry cohn was certainly not one to shell out for it .
and definitely not during war time.the plot gets a bit convoluted as both ford and scott are put to the test of friendship versus expediency/duty .
the plot also involves some high class hypocritical skunks in randy 's town who are the real outlaws as far as the film is concerned.the four leads do a fine job and the best supporting performance is guinn williams as ford 's lovable explosive lunkhead of a sidekick .
the climax involves a cattle stampede and a shootout in the town saloon and is one of the best ever done in a western film.fans of the four leads and westerns in general will enjoy this one .
