loved this movie !
kicking it old school !
love the idea .
love the script .
love the characters .
i really really really loved the geeks !
i was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being honored .
this was right up with my favs such as saturday the 14th and pandemonium .
if you are a big fan of scary and silly then this is your movie !
only taken off one star because i would love to have had better sound .
not bad sound but would have liked to have more .
great blood splatters .
great murder weapons .
great costumes !
i really love the nod to the great 80 's teenager stereotype ala breakfast club .
and i can appreciate the non-cgi suspense .
really good camera action and light suspense instead of cutting to cgi .
i would rather have good fake that really fake fake.kisses to the cast and makers !
oh , loved the `` making-of '' too !
