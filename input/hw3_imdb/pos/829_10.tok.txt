well ... it 's about time !
van damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that 's his best film in recent years .
the plot is n't too inventive but the whole border patrol theme is interesting and the ex-marines as drug smugglers twist is cool .
but what makes this movie awesome is the fact that van damme is back to doing martial arts again .
his latest films have been more acting oriented , but in `` the shepard '' , jcvd is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape .
there are some impressive fight scenes and van damme shows he can still pull out the old famous 360-spinning heel kick .
for being a low-budget action movie , it does have good sets and great stunts .
van damme says some humorous lines and shows that he 's improving as an actor .
i 'm glad he 's back to dealing out some van damage ... i 've been let down by the lack of fighting in his recent films .
scott adkins is great in his role and van damme and him have a 1 on 1 showdown at the end .
overall , it 's one of van damme 's better films and it will keep you entertained .
a must rent for jcvd fans .
i 'm just keeping my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like `` bloodsport '' or `` kickboxer '' .
nok su kow !
