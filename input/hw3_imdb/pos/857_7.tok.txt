i caught this movie on local t.v .
at about 4:30 a.m. i did n't have expectations for it but after the opening credits i knew i was into something good.there are situations that are left for your interpretation to `` find out '' what really happened so your attention is a key factor.the whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main character.your sub-conscience also plays an important part because through a series of events and dialogs you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion.the technical aspects are very good .
really good in fact .
kelly overtone is extremely sexy and she 's candy for the eye although she 's most of the time in her white clothes.the fear factor is almost inexistent but there 's plenty of mystery and tension to dig from.i would recommend it for those who enjoy supernatural and psychological thrillers .
