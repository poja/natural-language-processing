this is a pretty obscure , dumb horror movie set in the 1970s everglades .
it is really stupid and lame for the first half , then it actually starts to get good for the last half .
there is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing , i do n't know .
it is mesmerizing .
i was impressed with the night time scenes , because it actually looked like night , unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime .
i feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule .
there are a few scenes towards the end , the one mentioned above and also the end credits that are extremely cool .
this movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its scooby doo conventions behind and went straight for the throat .
i was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be .
i could n't take my eyes off of it , and i had to ask myself `` why ? ''
