i absolutely loved this movie !
since i do n't want to give much away , it 's basically about about a mother and a daughter and the life they have together .
it 's very heartwarming story , between the struggles they have .
i also think natalie and susan have perfect chemistry throughout the entire film !
this is definitely worth seeing !
two thumbs up , way up !
