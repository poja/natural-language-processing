the centerpiece of lackawanna blues is the character rachel `` nanny '' crosby , who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy , ruben , the narrator of the film .
based upon the experiences of writer-actor ruben santiago-hudson , the film lovingly recreates the upstate new york boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s .
the first half of the film is virtually non-stop music .
the second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse .
nanny 's ability `` to take fragments and make them whole '' affects everyone within her sphere .
an especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband , telling him firmly , `` if you ever touch that child again , we 're going to dance ! ''
as delivered by actress s. epatha merkerson , that line is so steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair-trigger temper is frozen in his tracks .
from start to finish , merkerson delivers a commanding presence her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home .
this was a touching , heartfelt film with a wonderful cast .
as played by merkerson , the character of nanny simply radiates love .
this is a film experience that i will remember for a long time to come .
