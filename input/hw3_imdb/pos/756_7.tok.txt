you 'll either love or hate movies such as this thriller set inside a lonesome asylum in a far off lonesome land .
it 's not so much of a horror show , but a concoction of frightening imageries and wackozoid mental patients .
`` scream '' is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular drive-in classic noted for some strange and wicked behaviors .
notice the `` judge '' , who 's about to put on the ax from behind the doctor !
brr-r-r-r !
!
!
not much else can be described here other than some bloody tasty goodness , but when you get a chance , remember the familiar old saying by the hag lady : `` get out !
get out !
and never ever come back ! ''
.
do n't you wish you have n't looked in the basement ?
