first of all , i believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read joseph conrad 's `` heart of darkness '' , the book that was the literary basis for the movie .
with that said , i believe that this movie is astounding .
it is an excellent war film that does n't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the vietnam conflict , but more the psychological toll that it took on the young , inexperienced `` kids '' who were sent to fight it .
coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making , using many visuals to help tell the story .
the acting i felt was definitely all-around up to par .
marlon brando 's part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting .
his elucidation to willard at the end of the film reels you in , and reveals the hollowness of a man that you 've heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie .
those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film , because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all .
in my opinion , this is one of the most sculptured and best-made films of all time .
