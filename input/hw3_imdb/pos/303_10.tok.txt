i have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of coppola 's masterpiece .
i was lucky enough to meet martin sheen outside the santa monica civic auditorium one night in 1981 , as he waited for charlie and emilio to leave a concert .
he was very humble about the praise i shared with him for this work of art , especially his portrayal of the young captain .
this is , without a doubt , a must see , a complete 10 and an important part of american film history .
`` charlie do n't surf '' .
robert duvall 's famous line ( the other one ) does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic american war hawk in the john wayne tradition .
it is a surprise to see how young laurence fishburne looks .
