superb editing , outstanding acting , especially by epatha merkerson , and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack .
this film reaches back to the 40 's to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady.the actor portraying the young terrence howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate new york town .
the audience laughed , cried , and erupted in applause for the film and its director .
soon to be shown on hbo ( feb 7 , i believe ) - fire up the tivo and enjoy a great story !
