when i first saw this film it was about 1956 and even though i saw it again recently i have not changed my mind about it .
i think it was robert ryans best film , because he portrayed someone like my father , and he was a schizophrenic in real life , ( my father ) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse .
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt .
( my mother and brother had to do this ) when i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man , it was a very good imitation of this type of individual , and i was impressed .
