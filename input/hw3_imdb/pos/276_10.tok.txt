i was half-dozing as i watched a late night selection of short films -- but sat bolt upright from the first frames of `` i shout love '' and could not take my eyes away for its full , brief , perfect length .
with incredibly assured pacing and performances , this film maintains its funny/sad/insightful tone throughout .
the credits at the end went by so quickly and in such small type , i had to go online to find out the person responsible for this master work .
what a pleasing surprise to see the name of sarah polley , a major actress who is too seldom seen.kristen thomsen ( tessa ) and matthew ferguson ( bobby ) turn in rich , touching performances as a couple in the throes of breaking up .
as they work through a reprise of tessa 's favorite moments from their time together , both actors reveal dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents -- and to the director/writer 's skills .
the film creates a moving narrative with laugh-out-loud moments and caught-breath sorrow .
`` i shout love '' is unquestionably one of the greatest and most memorable short films i ever expect to see .
it has wit , heart and stunning originality .
it matters .
