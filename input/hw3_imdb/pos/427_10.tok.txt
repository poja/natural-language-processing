i have only see three episodes of hack , starring david morse , and it looks as though i 've missed 37 episodes !
well thats if itv 3 are showing them in chronological order .
i 've just watched 'misty blue ' ( episode 38 ) .
i have really enjoyed the 3 episodes , but then i 'm a david morse fan , ( esp st. elsewhere ) .
for any one reading this , hack is excellent .
pity its being aired on itv 3. the cast is strong , though i cant get used to the idea of david playing a bent cop , still we all know he 's the good guy wrongly accused .
i see gary cole has guest starred , what ever happened to 'midnight caller ' ?
just wonder if hack is available on dvd ( yet ) .
lovin it .
cheers .
