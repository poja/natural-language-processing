here is a movie of adventure , determination , heroism , & bravery .
plus , it 's set back in the late 1800s which makes it even more interesting .
it 's a wonderful , adventurous storyline , and alyssa milano is wonderful at playing the wholesome , confident , no-nonsense fizzy ... a great role-model .
this is one of my favorite movies .
it is a movie to be watched again and again and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt .
not only is the storyline excellent , but the movie also has fabulous scenery and music and is wonderfully directed .
this movie is as good as gold !
