the incomparable laura gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the french `` emmanuelle 2 . ''
this amazing woman did not go unnoticed , and was soon cast as the lead in this all new italian series , where she is the centerpiece ; a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world had to offer .
in this first installment , mae jordan/emanuelle is sent to africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals .
much like sylvia kristels character , emanuelle has not come into her own when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality .
this first film is basically about how she becomes the `` emanuelle '' that most exploitation cinema fans are familiar with .
filled with gorgeous cinematography , beautiful people , and an intoxicating 70 's score from the legendary nico fidenco , this one is sure to please .
those who enjoy the more story-driven style of the original french `` emmanuelle '' should definitely like this as well .
the main story here being an interesting cat and mouse tale of a womanizing playboy who comes to the realization that he has fallen in love with a woman who is the female version of him !
sexy , fun and totally entertaining throughout ; a soap opera to be sure , but one with enough skin and general eye candy to keep the male viewers entertained .
for some reason this is the hardest one in the series to find on dvd .
there has never been a legitimate dvd for this , which is very strange .
the bootlegs that sometimes appear online will have to do until someone gives this diamond of a film a proper release .
