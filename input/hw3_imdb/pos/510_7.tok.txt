i admit i go more for the traditional vampire tale , but this one is a real winner .
lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours .
there was loads of gore with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world .
a good one for all us vampire lovers .
