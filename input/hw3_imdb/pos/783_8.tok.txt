a british twist on harold and maude , driving lessons features a reined-in rupert grint and an over-the-top julie walters .
while it is true that grint is stone-faced like a redheaded benjamin braddock for the first half of the movie , it does not deter from the quirky family film -- there are things going on that are out of his character 's experience that would create a shell-shocked reaction .
the chemistry between walters and grint carries the film , though laura linney 's hard work to make her written stereotype human is also notable .
these performances combined with a fun poppy soundtrack with artists like sufjan stevens , john renbourn and salsa celtica make this kids popcorn flick worth a saturday afternoon .
