there 's not a dull moment in francois ozon 's `` robe d'ete '' .
it 's surprising how much is packed into this short film .
while reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim , a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette .
she invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach .
on returning to the beach .
they find that all his clothes have been stolen .
she lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day .
he rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl .
his gay companion is sexually excited .
early next morning the young man returns to the sea and bids farewell to the girl whose holiday has ended .
she suggests he keep the dress as a memento of their summer romance .
it 's a light-hearted film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea , but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes .
