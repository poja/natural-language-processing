this was a fantastic movie about two people , one a young teenage girl , and the other , a middle aged man , who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved ones.both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to .
the script , although written by gorman bechard , seems as though it was written from a woman 's point of view .
and at the same time , men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the movie.the end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless .
i would recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one .
it is clear in this film that you are not alone .
