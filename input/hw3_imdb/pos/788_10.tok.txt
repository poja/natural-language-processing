this is a wonderful comedy short -- one of keaton 's absolute best .
through a long series of silly mistakes , buster is mistaken for a wanted killer .
and , as a result , most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular .
while generally i am not a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes , this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability .
i have seen some that have had wilder stunts , but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace .
in particular , there is a scene where he runs across a table , jumps on a man 's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible .
plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed , such as how he really comes to believe that he 's actually killed someone .
by the way , this film is very similar to cops , also by keaton , but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.this film is brilliant and the only keaton short i can think of that i probably liked even more was the playhouse -- where buster plays every role at the theater .
