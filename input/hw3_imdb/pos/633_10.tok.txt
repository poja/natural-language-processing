man , i never laugh so much this year , and it 's pretty hard to make me laugh .
while i expected some hostel-style movie , the smile came to my face even from the beginning .
this film-inside-film shows a female stabbed `` victim '' messing the whole set until she finally `` die '' .
her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us , the viewers , that mute witness is not a typically horror movie.the main character , the mute american make-up artist billy hughes , is played by the beautiful yet talented russian actress marina zudina .
her performance is top-notch ; her character ca n't speak , so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensate.and , oh boy , she did a wonderful job .
her sister ( fay ripley ) is the girlfriend or the fianc√©e or the wife of the `` in-film director '' ( evan richards ) .
they were both very funny most of the time .
i wo n't spoil more , but the scenes following the bathtub moment , with them two , the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedy.the plot get twisted near the end , possibly misleading at one particular moment .
but do n't worry .
such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy-/girl-/friend .
