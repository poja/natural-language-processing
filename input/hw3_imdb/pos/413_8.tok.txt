legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star conrad radzoff ( splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by ferdy mayne ) dies of a heart attack .
a bunch of drama school students steal radzoff 's corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it .
radzoff comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating his grave .
writer/director norman thaddeus vane concocts a fresh , original , and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise , offers a neat evocation of the glitzy hollywood milieu , and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga-booga atmosphere .
the kill set pieces deliver the grisly goods , with a gal being set on fire , a juicy decapitation ( the severed head rolls right down the stairs and onto the lawn so a raven can peck away at it ! )
, and another poor lass being crushed with a levitating coffin rating as the definite gruesome highlights .
kudos are also in order for the stellar cast of familiar b-flick faces : mayne has a deliciously eye-rolling ball with his flashy role , leon askin contributes an amusing cameo as bitter washed-up director wolfgang , nita talbot adds some class as flaky psychic medium mrs. rohmer , plus there are nice turns by luca bercovici as jerky drama student ringleader saint , jennifer starrett as the sweet meg , jeffrey combs as the geeky stu , and scott thomson as the nerdy bobo .
popping up in cool bits are chuck `` porky '' mitchell as a detective , patrick wright in one of his customary policeman parts , and tallie cochrane as a corpse .
joel king 's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look .
the moody score by jerry mosely likewise hits the shuddery spot .
a fun little fright flick .
