being a fan of saint etienne and the city of london , i was very excited to see this movie on the list of the vancouver international film festival .
this movie has great shots , an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a 'not so well known ' london.the movie is held completely in 'dark ' colours , which i personally do n't like too much .
furthermore the narration was a little too british and the comments sometimes got a little flat .
other than that , there are some great comments by londoners and excellent shots .
finisterre does n't glorify london by showing all the great attractions of the city , but rather gives deep insights in what london is really like .
from the east end to the vibrant centre with its music scene as well as the 'special little retreats ' for londoners.all in all : +great soundtrack +nice shots +great insights-narration -tiering to watch at times -very dark pictureworth watching !
i give it a 7/10
