it really is a great film ( after being able to ignore blake edwards pink panther references which he appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny ) .
julie is , as usual , wonderful - singing and acting brilliantly .
i remember seeing it at the odeon cinema in the haymarket , london on its release .
however julie 's non-appearance at the uk premiere of star !
was most unfortunate and ( apparently ! )
due to filming the aerial shots for darling lili over ireland .
a reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not .
two box office flops in a row ruined her film career for quite a few years .
but darling lili , just like star !
, deserves much more public appreciation .
