recently had the pleasure of seeing this emotionally charged film by director mani ratnam at the 2002 toronto international film festival .
i have bestowed my highest honour of the film festival on this feature .
make sure that you do not let an opportunity to experience this cinematic gem pass you by ... but be forewarded : this film will make you shed a tear if you belong to the species known as homo sapien !
a 10 !
