in my review just submitted i referred to the young actress lead as katerina when it should have been veronika .
i was so involved with character and the action i guess that i was n't that concerned with names .
anyway , she and the film are brilliant .
as i said , the cinematography and the director 's use of montage are worthy of eisenstein and his cameraman , tisse ' .
the production design is top notch .
the placement of actors in the foreground , middle ground and background within any given mise en scene is worthy of study .
stunning , memorable camera movement , and an ending that has an emotional punch that leaves hollywood films far behind .
gee !
heroic self sacrifice instead of walking into the rainbow .
thanks again , john hart
