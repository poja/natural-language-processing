'blade ' would be an extremely above-average comic-book , vampire-hunter action/horror if it were n't for two minor flaws .
# 1 i loved seeing the all-but invincible blade/snipes do his slicing and dicing , but the whole `` yes ! ''
fist/punch was literally a letdown .
# 2 bad , no make that horrible , cgi Â– even for 1998 standards .
this is mainly in the last third , but some sprinkled throughout .
okay , despite those minor infractions , i really enjoyed this movie .
all actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'matrix ' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior .
so maybe 'the matrix ' copied 'blade . '
at any rate , it 's a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences : comic book geeks , action fanatics and horror/vampire lovers .
so , we have blade , half-man/half-vampire , or `` day-walker '' and his accomplish , whisler ( a la `` batman and alfred '' ) battling the undead who , apparently almost out number humans .
who knew ?
in a rare act of humanity ( blade 's more of an antihero ) our sword ninja/vamp rescues a newly infected ( coincidentally ) blood specialist/doctor .
meanwhile , trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants ( you guessed it ) supreme power and needs blade somehow to obtain it .
it 's not the most original concept , if you read what i just wrote , but still highly enjoyable .
you will want to see blade succeed , you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms .
and you will know what 's coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie .
still , watch this without trying to go too deep .
such as vampire spf-1000 `` suntan lotion '' ?
really ?
what about the scalp ?
would n't that still burn ?
just like the money they burn for weapons ?
uh , okay , i am going too deep .
once again , sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride .
