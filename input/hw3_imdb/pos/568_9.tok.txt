i just saw the movie , through netflix .
i was intrigued by the way the movie was described , but in the end , it was better .
i was moved in many different directions while watching this movie .
i was filled with hurt , hate , angry , bitterness , pain and finally relief .
to look at the young man accused , would break your heart , and convince you that they had the wrong person .
the smugness of the police , makes you cring , because just as the rodney king beating brought to light , the brutality of the police , this movie brings forth the total lack of moral fiber in these police .
and the fact that they beat this boy , and got away with it , only infuriates you more.but , i have to tell you , i fell in love with the attorney , mc guinness .
one of my favorite lines , when he was telling us what an a**hole on of the cops was ... the cop told him , to go on , keep sucking on that cancer stick .
mc guinness told the cop ... 'i always have a cigarette before sex ... ' i was letting him know i was going to screw him '' i have a new respect for some of the law in this country .
