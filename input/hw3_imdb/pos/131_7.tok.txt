a fairly interesting look at some characters from india 's burgeoning middle class .
although india is rapidly modernizing , her culture is not keeping up .
this film involves the patriarchal society , where women are not yet truly free citizens .
a land of arranged marriages , men who dally with mistresses with total impunity , and women who are expected to tolerate all this , will eventually come up short .
i was impressed with nandita das , who was quite attractive , and played her character with total earnestness .
but i was even more impressed with shabana azmi , who i understand is a long-time fixture of bollywood .
her quiet beauty and low-key psychic suffering was excellent .
the lesbian subtext of this film was never particularly erotic , and never titillating .
( darn ! )
worth a look for those interested in vastly different cultures .
