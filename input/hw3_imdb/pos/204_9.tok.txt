one of those films that i happened across through the criterion collection and as usual indulged as a change of pace .
that turned out to be a great decision .
i was almost mesmerised by the quality of the film , the story it told and the way it was told .
the almost minimalist feel to the film with sparse dialogue and almost constant music just added a whole evocative level to the film .
this really is a superb film to spend some time with and enjoy .
