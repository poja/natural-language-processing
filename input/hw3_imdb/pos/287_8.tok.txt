anyone who critiques 'jacqueline hyde ' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it 's intended to be is just not playing with a full deck .
just from the title , it 's obvious that this low budget horror comedy is n't meant to be taken seriously ... it 's as tongue in cheek as a nympho 's french kiss , and just as titillating .
the female cast members are all great and fun to watch .
check this out , rolfe kanefsky is the clown-prince of soft-core horror .
unlike most soft-core horror flicks , this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses .
the movie does n't even attempt to follow the storyline of the robert louis stevenson classic , but instead seeks out every way possible to create risqu√© sight gags and erotic situations .
blythe metz , the brunette femme fatale who portrays the sexier , homicidal side of jacqueline , is a real knockout .
watch and enjoy !
