the story told by the cranes are flying is not , admittedly , all that original .
young lovers are separated by war ; bad things happen to both .
we 've seen it many times before.nonetheless , we have n't seen it filmed this well , with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation , or destruction , or hopelessness .
all the more remarkable coming from the soviet union , and reason to conclude that tarkovsky is not the last word in modern-era soviet cinema.i was reading chekhov 's `` three sisters '' the other day , and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film .
in act 2 , masha objects to the notion that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding : '' masha : surely mankind must believe in something , or at least seek for the truth , otherwise life is just emptiness , emptiness .
to live and not to know why the cranes are flying , why children are born , why there are stars in the sky .
either you must know why it is you live , or everything is trivial - mere pointless nonsense .
`` likewise , veronika has a hard time believing that the war , and her and others ' sufferings , have been pointless .
better to assign a meaning , to live as if one 's life is significant , and not to give in to despair .
it is perhaps this thinking that prompts her to her final act in the film.btw as a minor correction to one other comment here -- there may be a pattern of v 's in the film , though i had n't noticed them myself .
but the first letter of veronika 's name is not a further instance of this ; in the cyrillic alphabet , her name begins with a letter which looks like an english `` b '' .
