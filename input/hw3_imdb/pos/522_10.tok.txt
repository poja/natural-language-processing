i like seeing linda blair playing in an actual `` horror '' movie again .
i had been disappointed with her in most everything since the `` exorcist `` movies ( which i loved ) .
what was up with all of those nasty `` b-movies '' she did ?
david hassellhoff on the other hand , all i could do is laugh .
he is not cut out to be a horror movie actor .
david needs to stick to `` knight rider '' or `` baywatch '' .all around , this is an awesome movie .
even for the eighties , this was an awesome film .
it has horror , action , and drama .
it is a suspenseful , and i loved the way linda blair turned out .
