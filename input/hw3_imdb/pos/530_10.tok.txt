i just saw this movie tonight .
coming into it i thought it would be good because i like natalie portman alot and susan sarandon is a great actor too , but it was way better than i could have imagined .
you come out of the movie feeling great .
the acting was excellent , which is something that can be hard to come by lately .
natalie portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at nyu , think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor .
anyways , back on subject , the movie keeps you interested the entire way through and i definitely think that everyone should go see it .
i would give more details , but i do n't want to give away the movie .
