i have to admit that i absolutely loved this movie .
of course as i 'm sure you know that `` malcolm 's in the middle '' star frankie muniz , and the ever so sweet amanda bynes `` the amanda show '' starred in this children 's comedy as two friends that i 'm sure that we can all re-late to .
the movie is about a boy jason shepard ( frankie ) and his friend kaylee ( amanda ) going onto an adventure in hollywood.spoilers aheadas it begins jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day life 's problems .
one day jason is hit by mr. wolf ( the big bad director ) .
jason 's english paper is stolen by wolf and begins the adventure along with kaylee to earn his father 's trust back .
they fly to hollywood in search of wolf to get him back .
frankie and amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to get wolf back , and all he has to do is call jason 's dad and tell him he stole his idea .
but the end is no real surprise , being the good proveles and wins.the story is cute and fifth grade humored but what do you expect it 's rated pg .
i really belive this is one of the years best family comedies .
not only is the childrens acting great , exceptional casting , well written , but it 's good clean fun .
it made me laugh as well as fall in love with it 's innocent message .
i highly reccomend it and would like to disagree with that someone who gave it a zero out of ten .
the unemployed critic is n't unemployed for nothing .
i give it ( well i voted a ten out of ten ) a perfect .
