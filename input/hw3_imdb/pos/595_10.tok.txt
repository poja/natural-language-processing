i have always loved the muppets .
though most children 's entertainment then was n't that likable , the muppet 's was .
the muppet 's are very , very funny .
they are probably the most likable children 's characters ever .
not only did the muppets have their own show .
they also have starred in many films .
from the muppet 's christmas carol to the muppet 's treasure island .
the first muppet 's movie , the muppet movie , was also , like the show and the other films , excellent.the muppet movie is about how they all got started .
kermit the frog used to live in a swamp .
until one day a movie executive tells him that there are auditions for frogs in hollywood .
so kermit takes off for hollywood .
along the way he runs into lots of people such as fozzie bear , gonzo the great , and miss piggy .
also , an evil man is trying to capture kermit.all of the muppet films are highly enjoyable .
i mean they are all very funny .
this film has many film appearances .
such as steve martin , mel brooks , elliot gould , carol kane , richard pryor , and orson welles .
the muppet films are all very enjoyable .
i hear that jason segel is going to star in one soon .
i ca n't wait to see it .
