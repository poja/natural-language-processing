this is a laurel & hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a bit too much on just one comical premise.the comical premise this movie mostly relies on is very simple ; stan laurel not wearing any pants .
laurel plays a scottish naive young person who arrives in america in full kilt .
for some reason he gets the center of attention because of this and his uncle played by oliver hardy thinks because of this that its time to put some pants on philip.its humor is well executed but the main premise also gets a bit tiresome after a while .
although the movie definitely still has its comical great moments , it at the same time is also far from the best of the many laurel & hardy comedy shorts that are still around .
the movie is simply too simple to be considered one of the greatest , although it definitely is most fine executed all , for most part.great good clean fun , just nothing too remarkable or memorable all.7/10
