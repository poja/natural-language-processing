if you like horror or action watch this film asap .
if the opening scene does n't get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse .
great action , excellent casting and top one-liners .
this is the only film i have seen in a cinema where the crowd applauded each chop , kick & punch thrown .
not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun .
its a pure rush of dark comic book action .
9/10
