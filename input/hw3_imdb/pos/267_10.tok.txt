after having seen the lost child for quite a number of times since its release in 1995 , and having read the reader 's comments ( mostly about jane tennison 's background and helen mirren 's superb role in it ) , it strikes me more than ever that no comments are made upon the brilliant role robert glenister is playing as chris hughes .
even after 10 years it is still one of the most credible ways of portraying the complex personality of a child abuser , carrying the weight of his own past.watching the episode for the full one and a half hour makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate for this guy , in which the hate prevails because of the gravity of his actions .
i have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor , but this one never fails to make the largest impression possible to me .
helen mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her .
praise for robert glenister !
