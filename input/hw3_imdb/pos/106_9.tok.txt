as well as being a portrayal of a lesbian love story , fire is also a comic satire of middle-class ( ? )
indian culture .
i find this is a quality which is little appreciated about the movie .
these two genres ( i.e .
deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire ) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do , but mehta ( somehow ) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection .
the servant jatin 's behaviour , the family 's treatment of him , the bedridden grandmother 's constant inescapable presence , ashok 's obsession with a swami 's teachings : coming from a culture much like india 's , these are things i can immediately identify as being typical .
they have been crying out to be pointed out and ridiculed .
while developing her primary subject matter , mehta manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully .
in fact , much of the humour in the film which provides essential relief from the heavy subjects of taboo lesbian love and gender issues , stem from this satire of the seemingly ordinary .
the film flows from the comic to the serious with great subtelty.all in all , brilliant use of symbolic devices ( radha compared to sita of legend and coming out of fire unscathed and , therefore pure ; the lifelong desire of the young radha to see the ocean finally achieved when she gains freedom ) .
kudos to shabana azmi ( radha ) , the lighting crew and deepa mehta ; their very un-hollywood-like ( and un-bollywood-like ! )
talents made this movie special .
one criticism : the first scenes seemed rather disjointed to me in that they did not flow into each other very well.the verdict : 9 on 10. nothing less for a movie with scenes so burned on my mind .
