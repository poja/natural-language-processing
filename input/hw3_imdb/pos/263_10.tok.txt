we really liked this movie .
it was n't trying to be outrageous , controversial , clever or profound .
it was just entertaining and was what it said on the box a charming romantic comedy .
every other brit film maker seems to want to change the world , nice to see one that just concentrates on telling a good yarn with elegant style .
