i , being a fan of rupert grint , rented this film a few months ago .
i thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors .
it was entertaining , and showed that rupert grint could play more than his most well known character of ron weasley .
his subtle portrayal of ben and everyone else 's great acting made this film very likable.ben , a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother , is looking for a job .
he finds one and becomes the , i guess you could call `` assistant '' to evie , a retired actress .
at first , it is just a way for him to earn some money .
but after a while , he and evie seem to develop a friendship .
evie helps ben break out of his shell a little and gets him to have fun and be happy with himself , and in the end they both seem to need each other.whether you are a fan of rupert grint or not , this movie is a really entertaining one with some very cute and moments .
i highly recommend it to anybody who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors .
