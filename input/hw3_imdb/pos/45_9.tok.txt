just a great soundtrack .
really enjoyable music .
outstanding cast , great lead performance .
worth watching.does n't really explain what happened to the neighborhood .
you are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegrated.this movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted .
i especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like jeffrey wright.the cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively , engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music , food , drink , dancing , gambling and sex .
