this is an extraordinary film .
as a courtroom drama , it 's compelling , as an indictment on the american justice system , it 's frightening .
for brenton butler the consequences of this system could be devastating .
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process , that it 's not about discovering guilt or innocence , but rather , is about who presents better in court .
in truth , the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty , or a guilty man being free .
every citizen has a right to justice , whether a perpetrator or a victim .
but do they get it ?
the film is well paced , understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i 've seen .
