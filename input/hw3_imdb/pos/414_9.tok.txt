ugh , what an embarrassing episode last night !
it was either a failed script for `` abc afterschool special '' , or the product of an earnest rookie writer , just out of college , making an homage to that classic pc anti-gun homily from 1974 , `` the gun '' .
in fact hubby & were disappointed that the closing shot was n't of the gun being melted down like in the movie !
no , i 'm not some nra shill .
it 's just that when the producer of an intelligent & nuanced series gets it in his head that i should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal cause , i 'd appreciate it if the lecture at least was n't delivered via 2-by-4 .
geez !
ok , the sociology lesson is over .
the message has been delivered .
the important episode has been aired .
now let 's get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence .
