this movie was fabulous .
it is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film .
the directing and camera shots are nearly flawless ( aside from the dog scene when he licks the guys hand , clearly in slow motion ) .
the plot is well written and realistic .
it was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like that .
i would rate bruno as hitchcocks second most interesting character ( of course bates is first ) .
robert walker plays a very believable maniac .
he didnt overact the part which made it believable ( much the same how perkins didnt overact his part ) .
overall this is an excellent movie , an absolute must see for any hitchcock fans .
