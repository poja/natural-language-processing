ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career ... .
as i had not seen the telegu movie so i could enjoy this movie even more.the story is about a girl wanting to escape the clutches of a local goon who wants to forcibly marry her .
since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine .
vijay who had come to play a kabaddi match there sees this and decides to help her .
the rest of the movie is how vijay helps her & how the girl ultimately escapes the clutches of the goon & the goon 's father 's political cronies .
the movie has lot of the edge of the seat thriller moments and will keep the viewer engaged till the end .
vijay is as usual very good in role of the kabaddi player .
trisha , ashish vidyarthi , the bunch of vijay friends all have done their job competently .
a special mention has to be made about the villain of the movie prakashraj.the villain 's character has been properly etched out and prakashraj has portrayed it very well .
surprisingly , for the first time , i felt sympathy for the villain in the end .
the dialogue `` hi chellam '' has really caught on with the masses .
the music by vidyasagar is brilliant and the song 'apadi podu ' is a rage all over..dharani has to be credited with such a nice masala movie which will be enjoyed by not just die hard vijay fans but also by the general tamil movie audience all over the world .
