i like the shepherd !
sure the acting was n't good but the fight scenes were nice .
van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins .
the story was average .
a texas cop battles smugglers .
this movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action .
van damme was never a good actor .
i think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2. if you 're looking for an oscar winning performance you 're not gon na get it here but if you 're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you .
scott adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial art superstars but his movies in this movie are great .
van damme delivers strong kicks and it 's good to see him performing martial arts again since he has not in his last 4 or 5 movies .
this movie is definitely worth watching if you 're a van damme fan .
