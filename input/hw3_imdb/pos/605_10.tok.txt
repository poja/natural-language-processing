in many ways , the perfect movie .
the `` incredible journey '' and horatio alger tale come together for a positive spin on the usually depressing subject of existentialism .
in essence , the travails of the muppets boil down to the finale song of the movie : `` life 's like a movie , write your own ending , keep believing , keep pretending . ''
they create their own reality , which has all the trappings of every epic tale : a lofty goal at the end of what is necessarily a obstacle-laden journey ; an ever-increasing group of like-minded individuals for camaraderie ; a nasty set of villians who are not beyond all redemption ; and a big-budget hollywood ending because , darn it all , they can.only jim henson could pull this off .
he walks the line between sentimentality and philosophy without swerving too long or too hard into either .
of course it seems odd that invest such weight into a film starring puppets , but in the end perhaps they are the perfect , uh , puppet to make these points .
the movie 's atmosphere allows for the pure enjoyment of the hollywood dream , the `` happy '' ending , unnecessary cameos , and bursting into song at the drop of a hat .
usually these aspects are anathema to quality in film , but the self-deprecating manner under which the story is delivered makes for guilt-free viewing .
one of the few films that can truly be called `` suitable for all ages .
`` the other muppet-related films ( including `` the empire strikes back '' ) , while palatable , do not touch the simple grace of this film .
take , for instance , the musical number `` hope that something better comes along , '' the duet of kermit and rowlf .
amusing in its vaudevillian goofiness , yet makes a bitingly crucial point about the motivations behind life choices .
brilliant .
