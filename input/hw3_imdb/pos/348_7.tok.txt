what exactly do people expect when they watch an al adamson film ?
are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories ?
you 'd think so by some of the reviews .
al adamson 's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy , not much more , so if you go into them knowing that already it helps , and they are n't necessarily to be taken at face value , especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value .
first off , this starts by ripping off the end theme music from outer limits , so you know things are looking promising .
this is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body , the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital .
of course nurse sherri tends to his needs and all , and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her .
and nurse sherri begins to change .
no longer the nice nurse , she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects .
there 's a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of sherri 's co-workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo .
this is not bad if you 're a cult film fan , but it may be bad if you 're a `` spiderman '' fan because you wo n't like it .
at times this actually lurches towards `` respectability '' ( for adamson , anyway ) but then it `` unredeems : itself with some ridiculous event .
if you enjoy adamson 's films and similar trash you may well like this , for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure , keep digging .
7 out of 10 .
