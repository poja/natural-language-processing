`` do n't look in the basement '' is my first horror film of s.f brownrigg.despite its low-budget it manages to provide some genuine chills plus a nice amount of cheap gore including a particularly nasty scene with a desk-spindle through an eyeball.the climax of inmates taking control over mental asylum is an intense melange of wild camera-work , gore and piercing screams.8 out of 10 .
