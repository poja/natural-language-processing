to tell you the truth , i do not speak tamil , and i did not understand the film .
my good tamil friend , kaneswaran kumarswamypillai ( wow , what a long name ) , explained every thing to me .
what a great movie !

after watching this movie , i felt i should have watched many more movies from tollywood ( tamil film industry ) .
the war scenes were amazing , camera work excellent , and plot beautiful .
the actress `` simran '' , what a beauty .
give her an award for best looking someone .
ding , ding , ding , come on i smell a oscar winner .
i didnt understand the songs , but they were excellent .
mani ratnam is a great director , and i hope his next film was a success .
