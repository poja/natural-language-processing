nemesis game is a mind-bending film filled with riddles , death , mystery , and philosophy .
in it 's simplest sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when you 've finally found them all .
the search for answers leads sarah novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling .
the final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth , yet sarah is so close to understanding it all .
what would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life ?
the movie was written and directed by jesse warn .
while this was warn 's first feature length film , the movie does n't reflect that at all , but instead shows polish and an artistic approach to telling the story .
carly pope was powerful in the lead role and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch .
i would definitely love to see more of her work.being based on riddles , this is a very cerebral movie .
it 's that 's your thing , as it is mine , then i totally recommend seeing nemesis game .
rating : 4.5/5
