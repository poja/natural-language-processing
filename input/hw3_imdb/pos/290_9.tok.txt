breathtaking at it 's best , intriguing at it 's worst , francis ford coppala 's groundbreaking epic 'apocalypse now ' is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century , and in my opinion , the greatest ever film depiction centered around america 's involvement in vietnam.what i like most about 'apocalypse now ' is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre .
growing up as movie buff , and with a particular interest in war films , i 've seen many films , which have attempted to portray the 'images ' and 'feelings ' of vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so .
films such as 'hamburger hill ' and 'we were soldiers ' fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of vietnam by depicting 'heroic battles ' which are , more often than not , tainted by the zeal of hollywood film production.in 'apocalypse now ' there are no battles , no heroes or villains , there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is intended to reflect the imagery of vietnam through the physical aspects of war .
rather , it is a film , which powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute 'horror ' of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century.the sheer brilliance of the acting ( in particular the interpretation of taciturn captain willard by martin sheen ) , along with the spectacular cinematography ( filmed in the phillipines ) , which provides crucial realism to the backdrop of the film , makes 'apocalypse now ' an unforgettable epic.evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a maelstrom of mediation , 'apocalypse now ' is not for the light-hearted moviegoer .
it is masterpiece that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated .
