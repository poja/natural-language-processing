in extramarital we see b-actress traci lords at her very best .
she 's all wrapped in horror & suspense here , a type of role that suits her very well.this mainstream movie lends a lot of its atmosphere from paul verhoeven 's 'basic instinct ' ( 1992 ) , by the way .
however , there are differences between the main female characters of traci lords ( '99 ) and that of sharon stone ( '92 ) .
for instance , in extramarital traci adds some tiny elements from her porn-past .
we also should n't forget mentioning extramarital 's three main actors .
by putting down a convincing performance , each of them greatly contributes to the overall quality of this movie .
all this makes extramarital into a very enjoyable b-movie .
its storyline shows a good build-up , its tense being well-spread from start to finish .
this movie keeps you at the edge of your seat , until its unexpected end .
