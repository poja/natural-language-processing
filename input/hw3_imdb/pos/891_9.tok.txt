created by dennis spooner , 'department s ' was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of interpol , based in geneva , created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle .
if a plane landed at heathrow with no-one aboard , if a man was found wandering around london in a space-suit , if the passenger of a rolls royce suddenly transmogrified into a skeleton , if a train pulling into a tube station turned out to contain dead commuters , you called on 'department s ' to sort things out.peter wyngarde played 'jason king ' , a flamboyantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped crack many of the bizarre cases .
king caught the public 's fancy and was later awarded a spin-off show .
he was ably assisted by american 'stuart sullivan ' ( joel fabiani ) and the delectable 'annabelle hurst ' ( rosemary nicols ) .
unusually for a '60 's show , the department was headed by a black man - 'sir curtis seretse ' ( dennis alaba peters ) if the show looked and felt a lot like 'the avengers ' , it was hardly surprising .
it shared many of the same writers and directors !
the colourful titles were designed by chambers & partners , and are worth tuning in for alone .
as was the case with so many i.t.c .
series , the music was composed by edwin astley .
his theme for 'department s ' has got to rank as one of the best television themes of all time.predictably , the show looks a little sexist and dated now , but do n't let that dissuade you from tuning in .
imagine a hybrid of 'jonathan creek ' and the 'austin powers ' movies and you 've got 'department s ' !
trivia note : the episode 'a small war of nerves ' features a young sir anthony hopkins in a major role !
