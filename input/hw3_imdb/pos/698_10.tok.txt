this was a excellent back when it came out .
it had some the best talent available and a funny story .
between candace cameron and tatyana ali , it was hard to choose who is cuter , and add in carlton from fresh prince and all the other big names , and you get a blockbuster .
ok , a made for tv blockbuster , but none the less .
if you can find this move , do n't miss it .
