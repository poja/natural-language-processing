goldrush : a real life alaskan adventure is a great tv film for all ages .
the movie focuses around `` fizzy '' ( alyssa milano ) who wants to go on travel for gold in alaska .
the only person who hires her is pierce thomas madison ( bruce campbell ) .

i recommend this tv film to all without hesitation .
