no pun intended .
i 'm not going to spoil anything about the story , but it 's safe to assume that you already know , what kind of character the main actor portrays .
and of course being a priest while being `` naughty '' exaggerates all that .
plus this is the most erotic movie from park chan wook yet.if you have seen wook 's previous works/movies you know he is very visual ( in a good way ) and it shows again here .
while it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface , it still has quite some heat hidden underneath .
and when that boils , quite a few bad things start to happen .
but through all that dark , there also moments of light ( fun ) to be had too .
a very stylistic and though provoking movie , that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job ...
