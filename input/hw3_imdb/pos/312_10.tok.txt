somewhere on imdb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times ( spielberg , copolla and others are named there ) .
the greatest argument was around spielberg and whether he is or is n't a great director .
the problem with spielberg is that while he is a master technician , most of his films lack depth.saving ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view , but its message is dull and while its very entertaining , it does n't make you think about anything .
an is the best movie i ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things , starting from war in general , the clash of civilizations , the condition of soldier in wartimes ( is a soldier a hero or an assassin ?
brando says he is neither , the french lady says he is both ... ) and many others .
the problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false .
but a great movie , and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments , not to solve them ... maybe coppola is right , or maybe he is n't , nobody holds the truth anyway .
you can watch this movie for its outer beauty , amazing scenes , great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied .
but what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality .
you ca n't help but make a comparison with the recent fahrenheit documentary.both copolla and moore tackle similar issues , but while copolla presents matters from an outside , objective point of view , moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of a documentary ... it is really a shame that a film like fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like cannes .
but anyway , if you want to start to understand a little of the vietnam war , the iraq war , the second world war and any war in general , you should definitely see this movie , and not the other one ...
