i was actually around 13 years old camping near the mccloud river , near shasta when this movie was being filmed .
my family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon , when they filmed vincent floating down the river .
a little trivia ... the scene where they pulled him out , was actually where he started his float down the river .
and if the stunt man missed the netting , there was 20 foot waterfall about 1/4 mile down farther.anyway ... i watched it at the time , and did n't get it .
it was n't until years later when i saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it .
it 's pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by jan at such a young age .
his movie career never really took off as expected , but of course he later found success on tv .
i wish this movie was available , cause i would love to see it again .
