i was n't expecting much because of the harsh reviews , and proceeded to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result .
softer colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of his previous films , in my opinion , allowed the narrative to take the focus .
though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was commonplace , i felt like many of the other things were not .
for example : how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her.the very strong and well acted love scenes.the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them even more.their strong differences of what it means to be 'vampire ' created by their prior life experiences.the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the movie.i 've heard and read several things about 'tricks used in other films ' .
of course .
however , i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and i feel that he does this well .
i do n't need a director to use new tricks .
i prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately , which i feel is the case with this film .
i recommend it .
