well , this film came on on a workday at 230am .
the cute little actress who played billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes i was held captive to my television till the very end .
it has you on the edge of your seat , then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequences.the only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film , causing certain sequences to drag just a little .
nonetheless , it was still very entertaining , and i recommended it to all my co-workers the next day .
