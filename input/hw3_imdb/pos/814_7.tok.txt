the story is about a working girl ( ann sothern ) who has a pretty thoughtless boyfriend ( paul kelly ) .
this boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that again and again he forgets dates or shows up late .
the final straw is when sothern has a birthday and kelly says he 's too busy to take her out to celebrate .
so , not wanting to just stay home , she goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man ( neil hamilton ) .
sparks fly but it also becomes apparent after sothern breaks off her relationship with kelly that new boyfriend hamilton is a `` love 'em and leave 'em '' sort of guy .
how all this is finally resolved is not too difficult to predict -- just suffice to say that in the end everything works out just perfectly.this is a very modest little film from columbia pictures -- with a relatively small budget as well as second-tier stars .
it 's clearly a `` b-movie '' despite there being small roles played by a mickey rooney and jane darwell -- as both had yet to become famous .
now this is not to say that these are bad actors or the production is n't any good .
in fact , given the production values , this is a pretty amazing film as everything seems to work so well despite having a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable plot outline .
that 's because the actors and director did a really good job putting the story across .
plus the writers did a good job of humanizing the characters and making you care about them .
the ending , in particular , is really sweet and practically had my tear ducts flowing !
because of these factors , the film earns a 7 of 10 .
