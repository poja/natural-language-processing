thirsti found that this film was beautifully crafted .
the cinematography was well above excellent .
i though almost any frame could be frozen , and you would have yourself an exquisite photograph .
the use of color stands out most .
in many instances the camera was gliding through the scene and the work was flawless.park chan wook 's direction was fantastic .
he had me believing unwaveringly in his far- fetched universe .
there were several touches of verbal and visual humor ( of a dark nature ) that just added another depth to the picture as a whole.the acting i would not call outstanding but it suited the film and worked well enough.for me , the only place where this film lacked was in the story .
at times , i will not lie , the goings on between characters just did not make sense .
sometimes the story flow was clunky .
overall , i was disappointed with the subdued narrative , and i felt it ran a little too long.but i still recommend this film , for its vision , its visual flourish , its dark humor , and at the end of the day , it is an interesting film even if imperfect .
9/10
