yul brynner is major surov , a singing , dancing , vodka-drinking russian officer stationed near the austrian -hungarian border during the hungarian uprising of 1956 in anatole litvak 's the journey .
though the film has yet to be released on video or dvd , it remains one of brynner 's most compelling performances .
because of the political unrest , a group of travelers can not fly out of budapest but are put on a bus to vienna .
before they can reach the border , however , their passports are taken and they are detained for questioning by the russians led by major surov.the major has reason to suspect that there is a hungarian freedom fighter among the group being smuggled out of the country .
indeed lady ashmore is hiding a mysterious passenger , paul fleming ( jason robards , jr. ) who pretends to be an american but fools no one .
she is helping fleming mainly to repay a debt she owed because of the trouble her past association caused him .
among the other passengers are a british journalist played by robert morley , an american family played by e.g .
marshall , his wife anne jackson and their two children , one of which is the screen debut of little ron howard.major surov takes a romantic interest in lady diana ashmore ( deborah kerr ) , and a romance of sorts develops between them .
she offers him nothing but disdain and a stiff upper lip , however , though we suspect that underneath her heart still beats .
the cold war intrigue and the powerful acting carry the story but the romance is never quite convincing .
it remains , however , one of my favorite yul brynner films and deserves to be seen if only for his passionate performance .
