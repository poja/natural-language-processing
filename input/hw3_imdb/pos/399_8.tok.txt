ordinarily , anthony mann made westerns with 'the big guys ' - james stewart , gary cooper , henry fonda .
.
.
the a list cowboy stars .
but in this b+ film , he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western .
the main character , played by victor mature , is a trapper/ mountain man , and ordinarily they are romanticized in films - robert redford in jeremiah johnson , that sort of thing , where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men .
not here .
for once , a true mountain man - vulgar , crude , animalistic - is the central figure , and it 's something to see , giving mature one of his better later roles .
the real acting chops are provided by robert preston , excellent as a self-absorbed custer type cavalry commander , and james whitmore , the poor man 's spencer tracy , as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other .
even more impressive is a very young anne bancroft as the officer 's wife , who is initially repulsed by the very sight of mature 's grisly character , then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize , to her own shock , that she 's attracted to him .
rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen , without the romantic allure that john ford gave such a place in his masterful fort apache .
the battle sequences are big scale and notably violent , and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format .
good show , and underrated movie , all around .
