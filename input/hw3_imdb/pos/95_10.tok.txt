animated shorts just do n't get much better than this wonderful canadian film .
this short feature is dripping with canadian references , and so , this film will probably be appreciated by canadians most of all .
but the basic story is universal , and it is told lovingly by writer roch carrier .
it is a hilarious story that i have known for quite sometime , and i was recently fortunate enough to see it again , so i simply had to write a hearty recommendation for it .
this is a masterpiece , and a must-see whether or not you are canadian .
