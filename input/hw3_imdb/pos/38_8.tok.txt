s. epatha merkerson shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago , jr. ( marcus franklin ) while growing up under the guardianship of nanny .
the film gives a good character study of both nanny and ruben and manages to capture life 's ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film .
the supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including mos def , macy gray , terrence dashon howard , rosie perez , louis gossett , jr. , liev schreiber , jimmy smits , ernie hudson , delroy lindo , and patricia wettig .
loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end , and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling .
but , overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by merkerson .
