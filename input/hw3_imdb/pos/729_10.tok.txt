it could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie ( you do n't have to throw cartloads of money at a movie to make it good , nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching ) but i think that is totally missing the point .
if your expecting fast cars , t & a or a movie that will spell itself out for you then do n't watch this , you 'll be disappointed and dumbfounded.this movie was thoroughly enjoyable , kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think .
the writer obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this movie and it shows through the end , just remember to keep an open mind.note : the school scenes were all filmed at mcmaster university and most of the rest was done in toronto .
