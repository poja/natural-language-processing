easily one of the best indian films ever .
granted , that 's not saying much ( i made this conclusion after a whopping 15 minutes of watching ) .
but i can truly say that fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films i 've seen.beautiful because of its imagery .
the best example i can give is the parallelism between the 2 female leads ( radha and sita ) and the characters of the same name in hindu mythology .
sita , for example , is the wife of the revered lord ram .
as legend goes , ram subjugates his wife by making her walk through a fire to prove her `purity . '
sita , in response , cries and leaves him , reuniting with her mother ( the earth ) .
this story has all sort of crazy links to the stories of the 2 indian women ( nandita das and shabana azmi ) .
the word `fire ' all of a sudden has many meanings - marriage , tradition , religion , motherhood , and probably a few others i did n't catch.brilliant because of its social overtones .
many who were offended by the premise for this movie should in fact be first to see fire ( e.g .
my mom , who actually loved it ) .
why ?
because although fire is an attack on tradition , it is also an attack on tradition .
in other words , that is its strength , not its weakness .
traditional conservative social mores ( whether indian or canadian or american or whatever ) are useless if they enslave you .
gender roles and self-denial can both do this.these are the things i took with me after seeing fire .
