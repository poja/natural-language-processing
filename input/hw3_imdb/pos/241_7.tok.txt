rita hayworth lights up the screen in this fun , fancy and delightful musical starring gene kelly .
rita plays nightclub dancer rusty parker who has dreams to be a successful broadway star .
unfortunately , her career is getting no where in danny mcguire 's night club .
when one of her fellow dancers says she 's going to enter a cover girl contest , she decides to follow her dreams and enters .
she reminds the publisher of her grandma , who he was deeply in love with many years ago .
but when she finds this success , her boyfriend is not happy about it.i had never seen rita before this , and i am so glad i did !
she has such a scene presence and is a very good actress .
there are some good numbers in here , not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to .
one thing i did n't like was gene kelly 's character .
he should have supported his girlfriend !
but anyway , that 's perhaps the only criticism i have about this movie .
cover girl is a glorious , fluffy film - perfect escapism .
not everyone 's ideal movie , but a wonderful movie nonetheless , due to rita hayworth 's star power .
great movie , truly impressed .
