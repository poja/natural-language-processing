i just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one .
paul giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot .
he would probably say it was easy , but he really does a great job and should have won something for it .
we 've had the dvd for several years and my kids ( boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9 ) will watch this one over and over , and the humor is adult enough that i do n't mind having to hear it in the background ( and i do run to the tv for the really funny parts ) .
simple moral message , lots of decent action and slapstick , `` bad '' grownups acting goofy to take the edge off , minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard .
