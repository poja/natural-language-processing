three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up without consciences .
as their simultaneous tenth birthday celebrations approach , they become cunning and calculating cold-blooded murderers .
nice-girl local teen joyce russel ( lori lethin ) finds herself confronting these little terrors when most others are falling for their angelic demeanors.hearkening back to films like `` the bad seed '' and `` village of the damned '' , this films ' premise of evil children may not be wholly original but it 's still pretty disturbing .
all three of the child actors - elizabeth hoy , billy jacoby , and andy freeman - are chillingly convincing .
director ed hunt and his co-writer barry pearson maintain the unpleasant yet compelling mood for the duration of the film ; they go so far as to have the little girl charge admission for an unwilling peep show involving her older sister ( future stand-up comedienne and mtv personality julie brown , whose striptease is a real eyeful ) .name actors susan strasberg , as an icy teacher , and jose ferrer , with barely any screen time as a doctor , add to the proceedings with their presence , while k.c .
martel , one of the youngsters from the original `` the amityville horror '' , is very likable as joyces ' kid brother .
other familiar faces like ellen geer , b-movie he-man michael dudikoff , cyril o'reilly ( `` porky 's '' , `` dance of the damned '' ) , joe penny ( 'jake and the fatman ' ) , and william boyett ( `` the hidden '' ) can be seen as well.touching upon such parental fears as children playing with guns that they 've discovered and being locked inside old refrigerators , `` bloody birthday '' is a little more than just a slasher variation with kids as antagonists .
aided and abetted by arlon obers ' music score , this film sticks in the memory more than some of its brethren , without lots of gore to fall back on ( although that arrow through the eye gag works quite well ) .bleak , nasty , and downbeat , `` bloody birthday '' is worth a look for the curious.7/10
