this is a piece of cinematic beauty , and it shows more of quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province .
it takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture , to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived , breathed , and ate everything maurice richard .
the book does this as well as the short , and i 'm glad that in all the time i did spend studying french in high school , this was required reading in both languages.i thought it was brilliant to have roch carrier narrate this story .
his molasses-thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story .
the animation was good , as well , very surrealist , which brings attention to the idea of this being a whimsical daydream , fancying over better days gone by.again , as a symbol of culture quebecoise , this is unsurpassed .
one can almost smell the tourtiere being cooked slowly over a wood stove .
this whole film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be canadian , and encourage us all to appreciate the finer things of family and our roots .
i 'm from ontario , and this film made me fall in love with quebec .
maurice richard va toujours vivre dans nos coeurs .
