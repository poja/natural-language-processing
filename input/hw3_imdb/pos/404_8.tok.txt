i saw this on tcm recently and , through the imdb i found that there were seven `` crime doctor '' movies with warner baxter as the psychiatrist-detective .
baxter is a bit long in the tooth compared to his stolid performance in 42nd street a decade earlier .
not noir , and a bit campy today , the movie also has a touch of the possible supernatural .
the plot , black and white cinematography and characters are far more complex than those of the mr. moto and charlie chan series .
there are subplots , unexpected twists and appearances by a number of b movie stalwartly we all should recognize immediately ( none ever made it to the a status ) .
it is a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes.i would love to see a boxed dvd series of these films .
