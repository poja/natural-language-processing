i ca n't really criticize this film .
it is literally the first film i ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals .
fortunately , seeing it again years later , it held up fairly well .
rod cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths .
no one believes him , including his best friend , played by cesar romero , whose brother was among those killed .
and rod cameron was the only survivor .
the film was shot in india and has some good scenery .
the acting is on a high level .
i do n't believe rod cameron , cesar romero and marie winsor ever turned in a bad performance .
the mammoths , when they finally arrive are fairly effective .
the ending also has an unusual twist , particularly for a 1950 's science fiction film .
definitely worth seeing .
