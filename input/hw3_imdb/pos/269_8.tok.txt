`` prime suspect 4 '' continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice , detective superintendent jane tennison ; the first of three miniseries ( ps4 , ps5 , & ps6 ) with the notable absence of founding writer lynda la plante from the credits .
imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series , the second three series pit tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age , loneliness , indiscretions , a host of personal and professional problems , and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal .
ps4 conjures two stories while ps5 & ps6 are single episodes each which find tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good .
in other words , to prevail , tennison must overcome both evil and good forces , something which makes the always gray scenarios of the ps series yet grayer and the tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers .
very good stuff which only gets better from series to series .
