i have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind .
the trauma , the suspense is just amazing .
i ended so wound up in the psychological fear and philosophy of it , and relating it to reality .
movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you do n't forget , those that make you doubt your reality .
a problem could be the quality , but that does n't bring down the essence of the movie.the idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer .
i just totally loved it !
so many clues and twitches and puzzles .
one of the best movies ever , hands down .
