good show , really good acting , and the director takes us swimming through his storyline in an interesting , unpredictable way , especially since , essentially , it 's two people in a room .
it does n't race through like many modern films , but does n't drag , either .
bohl is flippant enough to believe her in the `` now '' of her character , which is still involved and not going back on her 'career ' choices - so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep , self-examination of her soul ... brundage has the delicate balance of weight , innocence , meekness , and class to pull off 'buddy ' very well .
a bit grainy on the film quality , but it fits the tone of the story .
could use a little polishing on the hair and makeup end of things , but definitely worth watching .
