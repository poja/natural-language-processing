you know you 're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you .
i 'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too .
every time someone says anything it sounds like there 's a narrator .
either way , this is pretty much the purgatory between boring french professionalism and the heavenly campy joe d'amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot .
do n't get me wrong , there 's a fair dose of exploitation in this one , but there 's always room for more .
laura gemser stars , and that 's good because she 's hot .
it 's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure , but she still rules over her white counterpart .
you can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of .
often .
every reason is good .
every person is good .
every location is good .
one scene even involves an entire hockey team , whatever they are doing in africa .
sometimes the plot gets in the way , and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people , but there 's enough laura gemser for all .
