although the plot of cover girl is very flimsy and tired , it does serve well enough as an anchor for the kern and gershwin musical numbers .
following her signature role in gilda , hayworth opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her .
besides looking as gorgeous as ever , she impresses with her dancing as well .
gene kelly , who was on loan to columbia from mgm , matches her in dancing and the sequence where he cavorts with his own shadow was nicely done .
the supporting characters were also competently acted .
personally , i did n't enjoy cover girl as much as the musicals hayworth made with fred astaire .
however , cover girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend .
my score : 7/10 .
