natile portman and susan sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a young girl , who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the nuttest women you will ever encounter .
sarandon has this ability , call it talent if you will , to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes .
as the mother of this obviously brilliant and muture beyond her years young girl , sarandon alternates between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer .
more importantly she does it with strength and flare without stomping all over portman 's portrayal of the daughter .
the question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot , who changes ?
this film is certainly about the daughter , but if you look close at the dreams and sacrifices that mom makes you come to understand that she changes in step with her daughter .
i am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also .
the hallmark of fine drama
