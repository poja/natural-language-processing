i saw the movie while i was in a class a few years back in high school .
i thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles .
i think the type of people that would n't like this movie would be those who do n't like solving things , or those who get frustrated when they ca n't solve riddles .
its a good movie , based on a true story that happened in my home town of toronto , ontario .
so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there , watch this movie .
and for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and character flaws , realize that in real life , this same stuff does happen .
but thats all i want to say on that .
the riddles are good , some are hard , some are not .
but the movie also leaves you wanting more , more riddles , more explanation , just plainly , more .
something more i want to add , is that the ideas within this movie , the underground riddle world , does exist , but there is a lot more to it .
to find it , you can not look for it .
to never look for it , would be no way to find it .
leave your mark , and it will find you .
