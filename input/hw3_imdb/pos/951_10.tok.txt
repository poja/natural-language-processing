if u have n't seen vijay in `` ghillli '' , `` gilly '' or `` ghillie '' .
go watch it .
wow .
its devastatingly hilarious .
i do n't know if dharani ( the brilliant director ) was being serious or not .
there are tons of hot guys in this one , look out for someone who calls velu `` maacha '' .
the one with the brilliant braids , devastatingly hot .
his teeth are brilliant as well .
vijay rocks .
trisha cries every 5 seconds .
it is very deep .
watch it , you wo n't regret it .
there are some great laughs in this one .
if you do n't speak tamil , learn it .
then you will get all the inside jokes .
it is one for the whole family , except maybe the violent bits should be skipped .
i 've seen this movie around eleven times ... .
and counting.wow !
