i think this is one of the best tamil movies i 've seen in a while .
i love the fact that it does n't revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly .
the cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl .
she was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother .
best of all are the songs , beautiful music and moving lyrics .
there are some great songs in this move ya 'll !
especially 'kannathil mutthamittal ' and 'velai pookal ' .
great songs , both of them .
i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting ( and superb songs ! )
.
cheers simran .
