wow , stella shorts are great !
lots of patrons from the state and stella , the tv show .
i never knew that stella could have gotten any better then they were on the tv show stella or even comedy central presents : stella .
i also never knew short comedies could be any good .
my favorite ones were pizza , racking leaves , the woods and david arranges to a meeting with his long lost cousin greg .
i think over all that david was the funniest one .
its funny when he does n't make sense .
i like the music in the shorts .
thats something i pay attention to a lot .
they always had good taste in music .
i wish they still made shorts , either that or bring back there sitcom .
i hope they continue making good and funny comedy .
