whenever ida lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30's,40 's and 50 's , you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white .
ida was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures .
in this film as mrs. helen gordon , '' high sierra '' , '41 along with robert ryan , ( howard wilton ) , '' golden gloves '' , '40 she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor mrs. gordon will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection .
if you liked ida lupino , who could play the roles as a criminal in a woman 's prison and prison warden who was hated , this is the film for you to enjoy .
i truly believe that ida lupino was not given the true credit she deserved for her great talents in the movie industry !
