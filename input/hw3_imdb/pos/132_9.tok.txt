this film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition .
all this against a backdrop of an india which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values .
this film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front .
it is easy to see why `` fire '' has caused riots in india , but tragic nonetheless .
a true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world , not just privileged westerners .
