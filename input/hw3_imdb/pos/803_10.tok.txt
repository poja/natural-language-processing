the movie was very good .
i 'm an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing .
while i did figure out who was going to be killed i did n't figure out who did it .
i was n't happy with the portrayal of the gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying ' .
please know that while these poirot movies are good , they just do n't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they do n't have japp , ms. lemon and especially hastings !
david suchet is definitely poirot .
i have seen every actor who 's played him .
the worst was peter ustinov !
