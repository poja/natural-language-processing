mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with kannathil muthamittal .
such an amazing relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful fashion .
mani sir as usual without much special effects and not much outdoor shoots .
( in fact this was the only movie where he went outside india ever..that too just to sri lanka ) .mani 's class is written all over the movie ... and to add to it arr 's music..which is just amazing ... vellai pookal is one of my most fav songs ever ... maddy , who is what he is in the film industry has impressed a lot too .
starting from alaipayuthey , to kannathil to ayutha ezuthu to guru.. mani ratnam has showed to the world what a versatile actor maddy is .
simran has been really good too .
she has showed that she can act too in non-glamorous and character roles .
in all an amazing movie .
sad that the tamil public could not appreciate this gr8 movie and it bombed at the box-office ... .
