three children are born at the exact same time , during a lunar eclipse.just before their 10th birthday they embark on a killing spree .
`` bloody birthday '' is a typical slasher from early 80's.it 's a pretty average stuff with plenty of nudity.the evil children never generate any menace and there is almost no suspense.there is also no gore or scares in `` bloody birthday '' , but the film is mildly entertaining.unfortunately no real explanation is provided for the kids sudden homicidal mania.the murder scenes are quite gruesome for example we 've got death by handgun , baseball bat , skipping rope and shovel.so if you 're a fan of early 80 's slasher movies give this one a look .
