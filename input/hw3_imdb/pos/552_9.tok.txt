being a freshman in college , this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mom .
of course , my situation does n't parrallel with natalie portman and surandon 's situation ; but my mom and i have grown up with the typical mother and daughter fights .
there is always the mother telling you what to do , or not being the kind of mother you want to be .
i was balling my eyes at the end of this movie .
surandon 's reaction of her daughter going to the east coast , miles away , after all they 've been through reminded me of how i felt , being from a small city in the west coast , going to new york .
the movie is meant for women who have children that are now all grown up .
it is very touching , i was moved by the movie .
every feeling out of the characters in this movie was utterly real , you did n't get any phony sentimentality .
i was sitting through the credits at the screening of this movie , alone , wishing my mother was sitting next to me so i could hug her and thank her for everything .
this movie is a bit corny of course , but everything is trully momentous .
its all about what a mom can learn from her child ; and what a child learns from her mother .
