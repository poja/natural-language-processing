keira knightley and sienna miller stars in the story of two of the women in the life of dylan thomas .
knightley is thomas 's boyhood sweetheart he re-encounters during the blitz .
meeting at a bar they reconnect , however things become complicated when thomas ' brings his wife ( miller ) along the next time he meets her .
the women hit it off and things proceed at pace until the trio are joined by the man who will become knightly 's husband .
this further complicates things as jealousy begins to show its face.beautiful to look at , extraordinarily written and wonderfully acted ( everyone disappears completely into their roles ) this is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and the ears .
it 's so nice to see a film about adults being adults .
on a purely visceral level i really enjoyed watching the film because the film is so artistically pleasing .
rarely have i ever seen a film that is this beautifully crafted.the trouble with the film is i 'm not entirely sure of everything that happened .
something seemed to be missing and a couple of times i had to replay the film to see if i missed something .
its not bad , but its not completely satisfying as a result .
( i tried to look up on line to see how much of the film is true but i could n't find anything ) still i think this is a film worth seeing .
it 's a beautiful film for adults with probably the best acting the leads have done .
