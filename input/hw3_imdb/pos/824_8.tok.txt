i have not seen a van damme flick for a while , pleasantly surprised , he still has it , looking older , but tougher , kind of like sly , becomes more rugged with age .
this is a good flick and has prompted me to take a look at all the van damme movies i have missed over the last ten years .
i would like to see a good director put van damme on the big screen with a good plot .
van damme still has the moves to amaze the audiences , the last movie viewed with van damme was legionnaire , that was a good flick as well .
in addition , i looked in to van damme 's early fighting history , i too my amazement i realized he is the real deal , very accomplished martial artist in his younger years .
