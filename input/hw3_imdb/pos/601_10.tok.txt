first of all i 'd like to say that this movie is the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind .
it is the best out of all the excellent muppet movies , and every other movie out there !
so boo-ya for jim henson !
this movie is the first of all the muppet movies and the best .
( boo ya ) it 's about a frog ( kermit ) who tries to make to hollywood .
along with the awesome friends he meets on the way comes a couple of the greatest songs ever made that are bound to become classics , including `` the rainbow connection '' in conclusion i would like to say that watching this movie was the greatest thing ever !
.
if you hav n't already seen it , then get off your computer and get you tushy to your nearest video store !

( if they do n't have the muppet movie , i 'd sue them big time )
