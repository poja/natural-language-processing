i have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was .
once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you .
`` you are alone '' is that movie ( for me ) .
the film is constantly in my head and in my heart .
i replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again , as if i am seeing it for the first time.there is nothing i did not like about the movie .
amazing soundtrack !
!
!
the ending was perfect .
very emotionally stirring !
!
!
it was compelling and riveting.i adored jessica bohl and her performance was the greatest i have ever witnessed .
i admired brittany 's strength ( what a strong woman ) .the tag line is `` when your darkest moments come to life '' .
we never know what we are capable of doing .
everyone says oh i would never do that , when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation .
we are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject .
the honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part.thank you gorman becherd for a perfect piece of art !
