`` cover girl '' is the best musical rita hayworth ever made .
ms. hayworth will always be remembered for `` gilda '' , however , the next movie would be `` cover girl '' .
the story is great .
it is about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in show business .
she does it without the help of her talented dancer/director boyfriend ( gene kelly ) .
mr. kelly is given the chance to choreograph the musical numbers .
the dances are spectacular .
it is fun to see phil silvers , a comic , do the musical numbers with ms. hayworth and mr. kelly .
the supporting cast is perfect .
lee bowman is given a chance to be an interesting third wheel , the other boyfriend .
