this movie is really an entertaining , good clean fun movie , for the kiddies .
kaley ( played by nickelodeon 's talented amanda ) is the sidekick to a rambunctious boy who has a hard time telling the truth .
he eventually works this into a movie script that gets stolen .
i wo n't bore you with the details .
if you have children and want to see an entertaining if not thrilling kids movie , i highly recommend this one .
