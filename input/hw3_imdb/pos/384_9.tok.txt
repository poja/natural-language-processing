`` lets swap murders- your wife , my father '' - seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - bruno anthony and guy haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey .
guy , a solid , respectable tennis player , whose problem is that his wife , the flirtatious miriam , wo n't divorce him so he can marry senators daughter anne , laughs the whole conversation off as a joke .
the following week he is n't laughing any more .
in a scene of classic hitchcock suspense , bruno stalks miriam through a carnival and strangles her .
as he does , her glasses fall off and we see the murder eerily reflected twice through her lenses .
cold hearted and amoral bruno , his part of the deal completed , approaches an appalled guy expecting , even pressuring him into 'doing his bit . '
matters are not helped when anne 's precocious and outspoken younger sister turns up suspecting guy of miriam 's murder .
so accused of a murder he did n't commit and expected to commit another , what is guy going to do ?
the power of this film is in the presentation of human beings as having a murderous side to their nature - and this hitchcock does to perfection .
