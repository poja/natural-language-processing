i use imdb very much .
mainly reading comments of other people about movies i´ve or not seen .
i´ve thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life , and the way i look a movie .
i think i have seen it at least a dozen times since autumn 94 , when i saw it in the theatre for the first time.i feel kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time .
and i think this is his best one .
it was his last one .
i was very sad the day i knew he has died , because sure we lost the chance to get something more from him.red is just the best kieslowski + incredibile performance by trintignant & jacob + cinematography by sobocinski .
if you haven´t seen it look for it !
!
!
if you have , just come back to it !
!
red : just a masterpiece .
please , forgive my poor english !
