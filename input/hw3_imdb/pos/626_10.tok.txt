i love this movie !
i think i 've seen it 5 times already ( it was quite a success in france and they often play it on tv ) .
ok , it 's a thriller and there is great tension .
but mostly ( and specifically in the second part ) it is absolutely hilarious !
and very original .
the directing and photography are just splendid .
