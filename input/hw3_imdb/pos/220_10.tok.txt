after reading over all these reviews i 'm very surprised to see that no one has even once noted that this show was based on the 1957 to 1960 nbc cop show `` m squad '' starring lee marvin , i read reviews comparing it to `` dragnet '' and some of the quinn martin police shows , but if you watch m squad you 'll see it was based on it .
in the late 1958 episodes of m squad onwards , you 'll see lee marvin who plays lieutenant detective frank ballinger get out of his car and then hes shot at , and he shoots back , the beginning of police squad is basically the same ( including the jazz music ) and then lee marvin narrates what goes on , ( im lieutenant detective frank ballinger , m squad , a special department of the chicago police ) and in police squad leslie neilsen does the same ( im detective lieutenant frank drebin , police squad , a special division of the police department ) and so on , in one of the m squad episodes there 's even the johnny the shoeshine guy character and in a m squad episode entitled `` more deadly '' there 's a police squad episode entitled `` a substantial gift ( the broken promise ) '' which is the same story !
