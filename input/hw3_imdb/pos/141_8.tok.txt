i hate vampire movies .
with that said , this one was very interesting to me .
i do want to point out one thing tho .
`` bakjwi '' literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories , you see count dracula or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva .
we also know that bats are mammals that can fly thus many categorizes them to be `` exceptional . ''

sang-hyun 's blind priest friend , sang-hyun 's effort to quench thirst and his sexual desire , tae-ju playing both sides , her ordinary boring life vs. her thrill seeking vampire adventure , etc ( wo n't ruin too much , u have to watch the film ) and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance , sex , violence , religion , dark-comedy , tragedy , vengeance , you name it !
i feel like many would find this movie boring and too long , but this film is very fresh and new , something that i have n't seen b4 yet .
i would n't say this is cw park 's best work , but it is mos .
def .
the strangest to comprehend yet darkly intriguing !
