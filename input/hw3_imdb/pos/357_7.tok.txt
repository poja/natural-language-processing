i would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment .
i watched this not expecting too much from it .
the fact is that the cast were superb , especially the lead teen female .
the dark sides of them all came through , all were messed up in an not obvious way .
there was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality .
the serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children .
what this movie is , is a strong drama/thriller .
yes i would agree they do n't do the obvious , but you could relate with the messed up teenage heads they did what they did and it is believable .
also a decent dark ending , instead of which could have so easily been an opt out happy one .
the attention to detail in the movie was fantastic also .
i very good solid 7 out of 10. a little slow at times , but lets a thinking person see where the characters are coming from .
