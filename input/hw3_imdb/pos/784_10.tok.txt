i just saw this movie at the tribeca film festival and i have to say that i thought it was amazing .
the combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worthwhile .
the movie was about a seventeen year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious .
the seventeen year old , ben , decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls and driving and life .
it is very comical and touching .
i honestly have to say that it is now one of my favorite movies .
i recommend this movie to anyone and everyone .
if you did n't catch one of the showings at the film festival , it 's supposed to come out in theaters later in the year .
please go see it !
it is a great film .
