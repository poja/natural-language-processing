i absolutely adored this movie .
for me , the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast it is from legal dramas like `` boston legal '' or `` ally mcbeal '' or even `` la law . ''
this is reality .
the law is not bs , won in some closing argument or through some ridiculous defense you pull out of your butt , like the `` chewbacca defense '' on south park . )
this is a real travesty of justice , the legal system gone horribly wrong , and the work by good lawyers - not the shyster stereotype , who use all of their skills to right it .
it will do more for restoring your faith in humanity than any frank capra movie or to kill a mockingbird .
and most importantly , i wept .
during the film , during the featurette included at the end of the dvd - it 's amazing .
wonderful film ; wonderfully made .
thank god the filmmakers made it .
