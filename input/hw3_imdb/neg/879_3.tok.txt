here in australia nights in rodanthe is being promoted in the same class as the notebook .
quite frankly what a lot of rot.this film is a like a recipe .
on paper we have all the right ingredients ... richard gere normally perfect in this genre , diane lane an old favourite from `` under tuscan sun '' and `` unfaithful '' , ocean side location , solitude and yet the movie sucks .
at the session we went to yesterday afternoon a women next to my wife fell asleep and half way through the movie got up and left !
the main problem is there is no build up or credibility to the relationship in the first place .
and perhaps there are too many long faces and downbeat if you like histories that gere and lane 's characters bring to the movie .
there 's hours of those balanced out with perhaps 5 minutes of what we can to see ... romance !
there 's no warmth from gere 's character , lane looks dreadful at the start of the movie and all washed out .
so as the viewer we can not really connect to the characters.others here say the book is great .
well be it the screenplay , direction or production someone here has made a real mess of this movie .
it 's like the scenes and the buildup are a deck of cards except instead of being in the correct order they 've just been thrown together all over the place.very disappointing ... save your money for when it hits the video shops and even then wait for a good deal when it goes to the weekly rate .
