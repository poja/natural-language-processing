this 3-hour made-for-tv miniseries came home with us from blockbuster 's this weekend .
the production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets , costuming ( bridget fonda , especially ) , and special effects ( including a great jim henson talking polar bear & reindeer ) .
they should have spent a bit more money getting a coherent script .
the story line was so loose that it really never came together .
one can overlook irish-accented germans , but not herky-jerky storytelling .
with senseless loose ends which included a special guest appearance by the devil , this one is certainly not destined to be a christmas classic .
a shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leads .
