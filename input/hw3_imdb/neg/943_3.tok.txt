let me start by saying that there 's really no reason to watch this movie .
i only sat through it because i was trying to kill some time before going to work.basically , it 's your typical sophomoric `` comedy '' aimed at the teenage set .
there 's nothing remarkable about it other than the complete ridiculousness of the story , not to mention that there are plot holes big enough to sail a carnival cruise-liner through .
obviously this is n't supposed to be a realistic movie , it 's supposed to be funny .
sadly , it mostly fails on that count as well .
i must admit that i laughed a few times , but mainly in a `` holy sh*t , i ca n't believe how stupid this is '' kind of way.if you never see this movie you 're not missing a thing .
