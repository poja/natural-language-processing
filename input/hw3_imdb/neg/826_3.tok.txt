ali g was funny at first .
his interviews were fresh and original .
the idea of a mock gangster wearing ott clothes and using street wise lingo was appealing at first.but this film is just a rehash of old jokes , the humour was mainly childish and revolved around the male sex organ for the most part .
the film claimed good actors like charles dance , but their talents were wasted as they played silly 2-d characters .
it is not 'terrible ' but is n't really funny at all a second time .
it could be said that the movie was ali g 's last bastion of comedy .
after that he ran out of steam .
