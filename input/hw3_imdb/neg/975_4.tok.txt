two popular actors are paired in showtime like de niro and murphy playing a police and an actor .
although they share the most screen time together , they do not reach their expected performances such films like analyse this , meet the parents , dr doolittle and nutty professor .
the film starts interestingly but becomes a thin , ordinary comedy which is quite disappointing.it feels like especially de niro does n't enjoy being in showtime .
thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what i think .
unfortunately , if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular hollywood movie .
well , i do n't think there would be a sequel to this at least casting de niro and murpy again .
