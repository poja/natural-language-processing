this was a mish mash of a film that started out going nowhere , got lost on the way then suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title character is finally introduced .
there were so many ugly , mutton-chopped guys in this film , i lost track of who was the owner and who were the overseers .
i have a theory about the casting though ; all the bad guys were played by ugly actors ( and one ugly actress ) and all the good guys/victims were played by beautiful actors .
indeed the actors who played the ultimate victims , the slaves , were gorgeous as was the innocent priest 's daughter , while the plantation owner , his minipulative mistress and his overseers were pretty hard on the eyes .
on purpose ?
you make the call.i hung in there till the end and some others might be able to make it as well .
if you just want to look at bare breasts , there are plenty of them here and if you have a slave/master fetish then you 'll love this film .
otherwise , watch it once , vomit , shower and never speak of it to anyone .
