the box ( 2009 ) * cameron diaz , james marsden , frank langella , james rebhorn , holmes osborne , sam oz stone , celia weston .
truly disappointing adaptation of genre legend richard matheson 's sci-fi chiller `` button , button '' by on the wane wunderkind filmmaker richard kelly who truly stretches a small , well-crafted piece into a grab-bag 'wtf'-a-thon !
mysterious ( and ridiculously maimed ! )
man , langella , posits a million dollar offer to 'struggling ' couple diaz and marsden ( both surprisingly vanilla bland to the hilt ! )
: a box with a red-button , that when pushed , will kill some stranger in the world ( ! )
sure strings are attached but does that really matter here ?
what does is why in the name of god does kelly trowel on so much oddness ( i.e .
nose-bleeds ; watery transport systems  that 's right  watery.transport.systems ) when the tension should be strung as tautly as possible ( oh the possibilities ) .
if this sounds like a bad twilight zone episode you are half right ( the '80s tv re-boot actually did a decent small-screen adaptation ; in fact rent that instead ! )
one of the year 's worst films .
