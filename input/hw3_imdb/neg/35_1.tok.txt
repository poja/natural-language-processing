maniratnam , who in india , is often compared with prominent world film makers and is regarded a genius in film-making , has yet again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good , without offering much food for thought.forget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of art.while i would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world , still any thoughtful and a bit educated film goer can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenuous plots , does not contain lingering effects afterward and mostly contain ridiculous ending and a lot of melodrama , seen profusely in indian movies.overall , maniratnam has successfully confirmed my distaste for his films once again.sorry for those who on this board were claiming otherwise .
my suggestion to you : watch some beautiful cinemas made around the globe .
