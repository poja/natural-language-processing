i always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a 'sneak preview ' at some of the old movies that are re-released on dvd , before you purchase them .
that way you could save yourself some time , money and a certain degree of aggro when you feel so utterly let down .
`` the buddy holly story '' is such a movie.i do not wish to go into the characterizations , or the holes in the plot , or the messing around with historical facts that this movie encompasses , for i had already come to terms with them twenty years ago , when i first began watching it.i had recorded it on the old ( monaural ) beta machine back in the early 1980s , and liked it so much , that it became a regularly-played favourite .
the best part , to my mind , was gary busey 's performance as the young buddy , and his near-perfect vocals and guitar playing.i looked forward to the day when i could have it in ... stereo ... , and that is where the disappointment comes in.this dvd version is ( supposedly ) re-mastered in both audio and video , according to the shell information , but i 'm afraid it left me sadly let-down and glancing at my watch , wishing for it to end.the sound is murky , bordering on the unintelligible , and so unprofessionally mixed that it had me yearning for the crystal-clarity vocals of my old beta tape !
despite what you think of the images , or the plot , or the characters , the real draw card here is the music ... ... and if you ca n't hear the lead vocals because they are drowned out by the cymbals , or the backing harmonies , or other ambients , then there 's not much left , is there ?
i 'm going to convert my old beta version to ( mono ) dvd for subsequent viewings , and put this one where it belongs , out with the rubbish !
