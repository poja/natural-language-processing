i gave this movie a four-star rating for a few reasons .
first , i felt that this movie was definitely preaching and i hate that .
still , it 's my own fault for watching a christian movie in the first place.my friend and i rented this movie because it sounded interesting .
the back of the case said something along the lines of a spiritual battle , someone opening some sort of boundary that let demons into our world and the like .
something i am very interested in , indeed .
this movie almost hit the target .
it was more like on the edge of the target , more on the tree than the target itself ... the basic plot of this movie is two couples are abducted by a group of terrorists to be victim to experiments .
however , because their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual realms , the men of the couples are now able to feel , smell , hear , and see the demons of the spiritual world .
in that order .
apparently the sense of taste is not present in that realm.this movie is very clich√©d .
they took the title seriously as the men , while chained to the beds , demand their women look behind them because there is something there.although a good effort for what it was , i think the special effects could have been done so much better .
the demon scratching at the woman was , in a word , hilarious .
the wife was obnoxious as hell and everyone in the room practically cheered when she died .
we were all hoping she 'd be beaten by the other woman with the chair , though.the message is one that i do n't care to comment on , other than i think the christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it.and so i give it four stars because it is not the movie 's fault i am not a christian and do n't like this type of message , and i got a kick out of making comments throughout .
my friend and i watching this movie seemed to resemble an episode of mst3k .
