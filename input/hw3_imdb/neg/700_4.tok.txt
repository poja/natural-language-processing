not the best of the lone star series , but it moves along quickly with good performances .
introduced as `` singin ' sandy '' in the main title , john wayne as a 'singing cowboy ' is n't successful -- you never even see a front close-up of him while he 's 'singing . '
the actual singer is the director 's son , bill bradley , who warbles away sounding like many popular singers of the day such as hutch or joseph wagstaff .
the film features : cecilia parker ( also seen in `` the lost jungle '' serial , `` tombstone canyon , '' and as older sister marian in the andy hardy movies ) doing her best katherine hepburn -- `` really they must n't ; really i 'm not '' ; al st. john , before he literally became `` fuzzy '' filling all his available screen time with his characteristic business of hat flipping , head and chin scratching , grimacing , and gawky physical gestures and movements ; george ( pre-gabby ) hayes as a gentle pipe smoking father ; and forrest taylor , minor vet of 395 movies and tv shows , playing the oily villain with string bow tie and prop cigar .
fun or odd moments : yakima canutt 's great 'under the stagecoach ' trick ; the 'gay ' scene when singin ' sandy ties bert and elmer together face to face , drags them roped to his horse , and dumps them at kincaid 's office , where kincaid says , `` you 're a fine pair of lovebirds !
`` ; denton 's rapturous comment after an atrocious song and guitar playing performance by 'sandy , ' -- `` ummm .
i could listen to that all night !
`` ; kincaid 's reply , we wo n't go into that , '' after being told by a rancher `` you 've got the soul of a snake !
`` ; and , of course , he utters the immortal , `` i 've made denton an offer he ca n't refuse . ''
the plot of the movie is saved by sandy 's tricking kincaid , and later saying the three magic words in many of these films : `` i 'm from washington . ''
fdr has saved us from the depression !
( is that why the villains are always either bankers or in real estate ? )
the shootout sequence is taken from the earlier bradbury film `` man from hell 's edges '' ( 1932 ) .
all of the lone star westerns are special because of their unique mixture of interesting characters , the troupe of actors and stunt people , and the spin on the clich√©s and repetitive back stories and situations .
this one ranks a little low , marred by the inappropriate and mis-used `` singing cowboy '' gimmick .
i 'll give it a 4 .
