i did not quite get barnens o  it is one of the weirdest ones i have watched .
the soundtrack was quite unusual as well  written and performed by jean michel jarre - it makes the movie weirder than it was .
i have to admit that i was almost going to change it and watch another one instead at times the movie seemed plain dumb to me , or boring  or confusing .
there are quite a few sexual references in that movie  trough they too are kind of messed up .
probably the only phrase that i will remember out of it is going to be `` when you are alone , you can control things ``  and `` i will show them `` - or something like that .the boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of not growing up  `` the last summer as a child `` he thought once  and he sure lived it to the max .
so if you have few hours to spare you can watch this movie  but you wo n't miss much if you do n't .
