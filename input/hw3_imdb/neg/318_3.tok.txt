my mother and i rented this gem a few years ago while she was here visiting for thanksgiving .
i have rarely laughed so hard .
this is a typical low-budget horror movie with dumb special effects , a worse plot , and even worse acting .
but are you really expecting a classic when linnea quigley receives top billing ?
i thought not.since this movie does have some entertainment value , i give it a 3 out of 10 .
