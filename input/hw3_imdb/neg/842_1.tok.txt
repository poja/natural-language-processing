having first read the novel , i do n't mind , for the purposes of filming , how differently it is scripted , as long as it adheres to , or at least includes , the plot .
for reasons known only to hollywood , important parts of the story are completely ignored , and a different story line added .
the reason this novel passed the test of time , is , no doubt , due to the interweaving of both the characters , and plot , as a whole .
to interfere with this structure , is to destroy the intricate balance of the story line , and therefore the intension of the story teller .
although a matter of opinion , the casting of this film leaves a lot to be desired .
characters , described as very fat , should , at least , be made to look portly , to allow for the character to have credibility .
the days of slavery ca n't be over , or surely , actors of this calibre would have been in revolt , at such a travesty of the story .
the face of marian halcolme is described as being manly in appearance , ... tara fitzgerald 's very feminine appearance does n't ring true .
again laura fairly is described as being 'fair ' , if not 'ethereal ' , so , with dark hair , she does not quite fit the impression gleaned from the novel .
... .badly done , hollywood !
