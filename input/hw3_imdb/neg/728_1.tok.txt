i tired on several attempts to sit down and watch this program `` gilmore girls '' .
it baffled me for i just could n't put my finger on what this was about .
was this about a young woman having a baby young in life and never growing up ?
was this about the daughter being more responsible than the mother ?
was this about a rebellious rich girl and her non-rebellious daughter ?
what the heck is this show about ?
finally , i just did n't care .
the cast makes me want to scream .
the writing is neither `` smart '' or `` intelligent '' it 's syrupy and tedious.so why did i watch ?
because i heard so many good things about this and i am not one to voice an opinion until i have watched .
knee-jerk reactions are usually wrong , so i watched a few times .
the first time i watched this , i saw the mother running around like she was 12 and the daughter acting like she was 40. maybe that is what did n't attract me .
i never liked any of the `` freaky friday '' films - not to say this is like that , but there are some similarities .
also i have a friend who watches this show every week .
so i asked her , `` what is this show about ? ''
a very bright young lady , usually articulate she never could give me a straight answer .
so i asked others who rave about it - they really do n't know either.gilmore girls is turning out to be a tv program that 's like an `` art house movie '' .
many of us wont get it , but those that go try desperately to find a meaning where there really is n't one , just to be `` hip . ''
yes , i find lauren graham 's lorelai annoying - whine , whine , nasally whine .
a whole hour of that .
wow .
and the rest of the cast is about as memorable as yesterday 's cheese sandwich .
the town is hokey , the men are wimps , the grand parents are boring , and sadly i find nothing redeeming about any of these characters or care about anything they do .
it 's like watching paint dry on the wall .
