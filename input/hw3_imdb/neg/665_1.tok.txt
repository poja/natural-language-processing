after watching this movie , i have nothing but contempt for any of those who were involved in the making of this abysmal film .
for one , as a general comment , the storyline was literally unbelievable and filled with incredible clich√©s all around .
the same obviously goes for the dialogue which panders to the lowest common denominator and manages to offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines .
the acting was terrible as well with kane showing , throughout the entire movie , at the very most 3 separate and distinct emotions .
even the use of modern special effects failed , as each prop was easily distinguishable from its real life counterpart .
overall , i would not recommend for anyone to even think about viewing this feature , as it will most surely waste 83 ( not even 90 ! )
minutes of your life .
