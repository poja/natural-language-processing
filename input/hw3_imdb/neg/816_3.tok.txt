i 'm a boorman fan , but this is arguably his least successful film .
comedy has never been his strong suit , and here his attempts at screwball farce are clumsily done .
still , it 's almost worth seeing for boorman 's eye for talent : this is one of uma thurman 's first starring roles , and as always she is ravishing to watch .
( on a sad side note , boorman wrote the script with his daughter , telsche , who died a couple years ago . )
