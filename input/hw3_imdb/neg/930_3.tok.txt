it borrowed scenes from lotr , matrix , star wars , etc .
the humor is so dry , contrived , and corny , that you ca n't help but laugh occasionally at its inanity and the fact that you are watching it .
exactly what you 'd expect from an hk comedy .
the average person would enter with an iq of 100 and leave with less than 80. stephen chow is an obvious omission from this movie .
the humor would have worked better with stephen .
the mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the cantonese original .
the graphics are poor compared to its hollywood counterparts .
there is overdependence on low quality cg .
my biggest complaint is its ending .
the origin of the white horse is so clearly described in the `` journey to the west '' ( jw ) , that this alternate explanation does not work well with story line .
despite its many flaws this movie has far more entertainment value than the other movie nicholas tse starred in -- the promise .
