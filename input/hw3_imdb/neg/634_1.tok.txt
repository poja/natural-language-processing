*this review may contain spoilers ... or maybe not .
the warning is the same for all*dang it .
just when i thought that scifi channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies , they give us this .
actually , the plot itself it 's nothing we have n't seen in movies like snakes on a plane , deep blue sea , etc ... that means , a monster/animal/menace of some kind is lurking in a close environment threatening a bunch of people .
in this case , an alien in a train .
wow.i must say that , when i first saw this thing on cable , i could n't stop laughing .
no scifi film had prepared me for this ; it was so incredibly pathetic i could n't believe it !
the actors are all a bunch of stereotypical-genre characters .
but since they 're not so famous ( to say the least ) , i was n't expecting much of them .
except diamond phillips .
no comments there , but i think the guy was desperate to find a job .
the problem was something called 'special effects ' , horrible even for scifi channel standards .
that model/toy they made us believe it was a real train ( not to mention the model/toy helicopter , bigger than a train 's wagon ) , the meteor coming horizontally from space , the 'baby ' alien ( a sock puppet , and i ai n't kiddin ' ) , the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly ... while they were static ; when they started `` moving '' , it was awful , the explosions ( the terrorist blew up literally !
and what about the exploding helicopter !
just how many barrels of gas was that thing carrying ? )
, the insane mathematics used ( they could n't even solve a school problem right ! )
... and i wo n't talk about that doomsday-like ending , by that time i did n't know if to keep laughing or to start crying .
if i remember right , i did both.it 's an ideal movie to have a good laugh , alone or with friends .
but be warned ; it 's so ridiculous at so many levels ... and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief ...
