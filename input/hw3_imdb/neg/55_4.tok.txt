i thought maybe ... maybe this could be good .
an early appearance by the re-animator ( jeffery combs ) ; many homage 's to old horror movies ; the troma label on the front this movie could be a gem !
i thought wrong.frightmare is a boring , overplayed , half assed homage to the fright films of yore .
the story is an old one , young people breaking into a house , getting drunk , making love , and tampering with things that should n't be tampered with .
the oft Â– recycled slasher film formula is used here , this time with a thought to be dead actor named conrad radzoff doing the killing .
in fact , the performance by the radzoff 's actor ferdy mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film .
he does the snooty dracula style character very well .
but as for the kids , its not so good , with combs only having a minimal part.the film lacks entertainment value , and only features one cool character , and one or two scenes that can hold your attention .
i do not recommend this film unless you are desperate for something to watch , and this is the only movie left at blockbuster .
