i never want to see this movie again !
not only is it dreadfully bad , but i ca n't stand seeing my hero stan laurel looking so old and sick.mostly i ca n't stand watching this terrible movie !
frankly , there is no reason to watch this awful film .
the plot is just plain stupid .
the actors that surround stan laurel and oliver hardy are really really bad and laurel and hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films !
i warn you do n't watch it , the images will haunt you for a long while to come !
