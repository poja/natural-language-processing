every great romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic leads to lend suspense , anticipation and allure to the plot .
this story falls completely flat in this area .
there is no conflict - at least none that would inhibit the eventual joining of the two lead characters , and so suspense is flat , there is no anticipation , and there really is no allure at all.the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane is representative of friendship at best , and with the talent of these two particular actors , i was quite surprised .
during the movie , i expected them more to play a game of checkers and chat about the weather than see any moving passion.while i 'm a fan of both actors , i do believe that the casting in this movie was off - or , perhaps the direction was off-base and it impacted their deliveries .
the writing was very weak , which also might have impacted the performances ; most certainly , the script could have used some help from some harlequin writers who have real experience putting the heat in romance.this movie may be worth watching on a rainy sunday afternoon , but only after it 's on the cheap shelf .
( sorry diane ladd and richard gere ) .
