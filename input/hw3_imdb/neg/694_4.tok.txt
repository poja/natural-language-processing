why do the powers that be continue to cast jennifer lopez in unbelievable roles ?
she was excellent in selena , and pretty good in money train , which both cast her in roles where she could basically be herself .
however , roles like this just draw the line .
i could never see lopez as an fbi agent ( see out of sight for that unremarkable performance ) , but as a psychotherapist ?
give me a break !
basically , lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist , who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients in order to help them sort out their issues .
when she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims , she breaks all the rules to try and crack the insanity of his inner mind.lopez 's acting here is typically below average .
i ca n't get over that high-pitched squeak of a voice she has .
she 's no julia roberts , but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field .
well , she 's not even in the same stadium .
sure , she is a very sexy lady ; however , that is n't going to carry a film , and it certainly does n't carry this one .
with anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been excellent , especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the character.having said all that , this film is visually stunning .
the colors are fabulous , and the story line is n't half bad in a b-movie kind of way .
the audio here is superb as well .
this movie gains some points for the fairly original storyline , and major points for how it looks and sounds .
unfortunately , the acting and poor casting bring it down a few notches.my rating : 6/10
