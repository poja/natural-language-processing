i do n't understand why so many of the comments here seem to indicate that this is acceptable entertainment .
the eye-popping horror of this cinematic monstrosity can not be overstated .
me and my girlfriend just watched it together , and i 'm not sure we 'll ever be able to have sex again .
i 'm not sure what was worse , the scrawny , unattractive cast , their supremely unphotogenic genitals , the rancid attempts at humor , the screeching noises that claimed to be songs ... no , i know what was worst of all .
the girls in the green leotards , with green facepaint , licking alice to dry her off , then proposing , in broken childlike speech , that they suckle milk from her breasts .
that was the worst.also , what was with the nurses , and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding each other 's vaginas ?
why are all the male actors gay ?
why does humpty dumpty waggle a dildo in the air and pretend that it 's his penis ?
why did my eyes have to see this ?
there are no words .
