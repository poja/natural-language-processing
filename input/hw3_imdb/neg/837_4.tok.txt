the film begins with a dandy gunfight , where three bandits are quickly gunned down by a bounty hunter -- a bounty hunter who bears more than just a superficial to the man with no name from the clint eastwood trilogy ( fistful of dollars , for a few dollars more and the good the bad and the ugly ) .immediately after , you see this man in a gold train filled with union soldiers .
naturally , the shipment is attacked and the soldiers all fight like blind guys , so they are quickly neutralized .
however , in a twist , one of the bandits cheats the gang leader ( gilbert roland ) and rides away with the gold .
soon , roland catches up and is about to find out where the gold is hidden .
but , just at that moment , the army turns up and kills the traitor ... .bummer .
however , the man with no name wannabe thinks roland knows about the treasure and perhaps a medallion given to roland by the traitor holds the key .
a strange banker , also is thrown into the mix .
all three want the gold and all three seem pretty macho.overall , this is not a particularly distinguished western .
much of it is the plot , some of it is that george hilton ( a uruguayan despite the american sounding name ) is n't as interesting as eastwood or some of the other premier spaghetti western stars but most of it is because the soundtrack simply sucks .
so often the music does n't even come close to matching the acting and it seems almost randomly added .
plus , it just is n't very good stuff as well .
this clearly is n't the work of ennio morricone -- music master of the spaghetti genre.overall , just a time passer -- and not a particularly good one to boot .
