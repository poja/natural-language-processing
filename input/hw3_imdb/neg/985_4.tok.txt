the most generic , surface-level biography you could hope for .
busey 's impersonation of holly is accurate -- but who wants to hear gary busey sing `` maybe baby '' ?
typically , the members of the hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama ( smith and stroud , respectively ) instead of as people or even characters .
when holly uses a string section , the old jewish-looking guys who come in tell him he 's using the same techniques as mozart .
it 's just this kind of cheeky statement that makes film biographies like this ( and `` amadeus '' , about the aforementioned mozart ) so worthless .
some entertainment can be derived from holly 's excellent styles and songs done in a b-variation .
