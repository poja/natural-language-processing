this oddity contains bunuel-like touches , but does n't sustain one 's interest .
a 10 year old roams a bizarro america in a stolen mustang , while the usual cult movie suspects ( dick miller , mary woronov , susie tyrell ) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy .
like his after hours and vampire 's kiss , the screenwriter delights in making you squirm .
i remained unaffected , due to the broad acting .
you know you 're in for it when meat loaf and flea give the most appealing perfs .
( and what did this kid 's screen test look like ?
he 's insufferable . )
recommended to the dozen or so fans of sonny boy ( '87 ) .
