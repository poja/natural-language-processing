`` may contain spoilers '' sadly lou costellos ' last film has the distinction of being slightly better than abbott & costello 's last movie together `` dance with me henry '' .
this movie is n't all in all outright terrible it is an amusing career misfire .
dorothy provine is nice to look at and makes the movie somewhat bearable .
you ca n't blame lou costello for this because a major studio released it which meant somebody had to give it the `` green '' light .
in my opinion lou costello was getting over problems of his own losing his son a few years earlier and the unwarranted attacks from the irs .
if you look at the last 3-4 abbott & costello movies you can notice the magic was gone .
check out `` dance with me henry '' now that 's a painful movie to watch .
