the best part in this movie is the first one , located in sicily , i suppose .
crialese shows a good talent for photography and the movie start is delightfully surprising .
the rest of the story is quite boring .
crialese uselessly insists on stereotypical situations and characters , trying to melt neorealistic suggestions and video-music technique , fellinian surrealistic remembrances and a very annoying and completely off-topic soundtrack , leading the whole thing towards an end which gives you the sensation of an exaggeratedly long story cut abruptly short .
frankly , this is a real overrated movie and crialese is a real overrated director .
