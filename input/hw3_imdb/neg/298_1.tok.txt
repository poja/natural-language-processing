how can you make a joke about mafia ?
it is not the kind of subject to laugh at !
a near movie can not make me laugh , because i am comparing it to jane austen 's mafia !
.
mafia !
was n't a good movie but hoods is really worse !
in mafia !
, there were some good jokes but in this one there are maybe two or three ... that make you smile .
not too bad actors but very bad scenario !
!
we sure prefer something serious like the godfather .
i give it * out of ***** .
