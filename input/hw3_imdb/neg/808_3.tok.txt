as a south african , living in south africa again after a 32 year stay in the uk , i am sorry to say that this movie is a huge disappointment .
the three main problems i had with the movie was a ) why swank and ejiofor - an american and a nigerian - to play the leads .
this country is bursting with talent and has no need of imports ... b ) gillian slovo has been trading off her struggle credentials for years now .
she 's a very mediocre writer and even her novel does n't stand up the flaccid direction of mr hooper ... and c ) hilary swank again , such a great actor , as proved in million dollar baby ( but that 's eastwood too ) , here dressed in the contemporary new york style whilst roaming freely around the poverty of the karoo .
where was the consideration and sensitivity needed by the costumer and director ?
yes , the film is ultimately moving - how could it not be ?
- but the overall mood at the conclusion is one of tremendous letdown .
heart 's in the right place but needs a pace maker .
