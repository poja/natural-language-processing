first of all , the genre of this movie is n't comedy , it 's more of a drama.i had low expectations on the movie , and still they did n't come up them .
as some of the other reviews point out , there are some nice music in the movie .
but if you want to listen to good music i suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with bon jovi , or m√∂tley crue , it 'll be more quality time.last , if you want to watch a good movie in this rock'n'roll genre , i recommend `` almost famous '' .
