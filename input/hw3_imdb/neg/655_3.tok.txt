i was pretty enthusiastic about seeing this movie when it came out .
commercials for it made it look quirky and i generally like morgan freeman and chris rock , and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea .
sadly , i was terribly disappointed with nurse betty.personally , i 've usually found that graphic violence and comedy do n't go all that well together , and the only directors that have ever combined the two successfully , in my opinion , are tarantino and the coens .
there is n't that much violence in nurse betty , but what violence is in it made me feel kind of weird when i was supposed to laugh .
of course , for me , part of the problem was also that there did n't seem to be many places where i was being asked to.the film does n't much work as a drama , either .
renee zellweger 's betty , the story 's protagonist , is clinically insane and impossible to relate to in any real way .
i will say zellweger acts the role quite well , and freeman , rock , and greg kinnear all do good jobs too .
the problem is in the writing ; freeman is the only person that gets to play an interesting character .
it 's really too bad .
