i did n't like this movie for many reasons - very boring !
it was interesting how they thought what the future would look like in this , but seriously i was very bored watching this .
there was hardly any action .
although the classical orchestra soundtrack was very nice .
the visuals were very creative .
whenever this movie pops on tv , i feel like changing the station instantly .
not because it is a bad movie , just because i know what i am in for when watching this - complete and total boredom .
it is a movie i saw when i was young , but i never got into the science fiction thing ... because it simply was n't real .
just like this movie - very unrealistic .
i never understood half the movie anyway .
