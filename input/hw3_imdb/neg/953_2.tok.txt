as a flagship show , attack of the show ( aots ) is endemic of the larger fall of g4 tv ; it is a show ( and a station ) that has fallen so far that it parades sex to try and cover its glaring faults .
its predecessor , the screen savers , was a venue for troubleshooting technology problems and scouting out the latest and greatest in technology .
it was a nice show with a likable staff and it was fun to see some of the modding and other experiments the crew could put to together.the acquisition of techtv by g4 bothered some longtime fans of the station , but early returns were actually promising .
the emphasis on gaming was a nice addition and i really enjoyed a lot of the coverage of e3 and other big entertainment events.unfortunately , aots now stands as but a shell of its former self .
those overseeing the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and gaming and toward anything that might elicit drool from young adult men .
the result is that aots spends as much time parading olivia munn or touting the adult film industry as it does covering games .
it is so bad it is practically unwatchable.while some may get puerile joy out of this sort of thing , those who genuinely enjoy gaming may wonder where the good coverage went .
equally troubling , young gamers who might tune into g4 thinking their getting gaming - that active gaming group between 10-15 - are instead being fed things aimed toward a more mature audience .
on a channel like hbo or cinemax , things like that are expected .
on g4 , it 's tragic.at least spiketv , another male-aimed channel , has good programming like csi .
aots , and g4 , has very little good left to offer.too bad , really .
