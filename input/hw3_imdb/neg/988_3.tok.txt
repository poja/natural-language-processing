being a history buff , i rented this movie because of the subject matter .
the idea of the ellis island experience at the turn of the century focusing on one small group is intriguing .
unfortunately , the movie falls flat .
much of the story is simply boring ; nothing much happens for long stretches .
the director uses goofy imagery ( offered up in the form of daydream sequences ) in an apparent attempt to break up the glacial pacing , but instead , it clashes with the authentic look and feel of the movie .
the characters are also poorly drawn .
in the end , we do n't really care as much about them as we should .
it 's a shame that this was n't what it could have been .
i would still like to see a good movie about the american immigrant experience , but this one is n't it .
