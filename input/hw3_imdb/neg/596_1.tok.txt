evil behind you , was created for a specific purpose in mind , to shove the writer/directors personal views on who either gets to walk on water or who gets to dance with the devil .
sadly it would seem that the creators were so focused on making their point that they took it 's power away completely by force feeding their point to the viewer.the way its message is presented almost reminds me of the stories i 've heard of the spanish inquisition !
from one real christian to another , avoid this like the plague , fear tactics never work when trying to send this kind of message !
!
the acting was horrible , the selection of muslim terrorists was racist and unfair ( they 're terrorists so they must be muslims ) .
the premise of this was good , the story provided a great conduit for its message , however it was the execution of these ideas that fell short making it very difficult to even separate the message from the messenger so to speak.you 'd be better off dusting off your old `` ghost '' dvd with mr swayze to better receive this message .
at least that movie did n't try to shove itself down your throat .
or if you like good christian movies with a powerful message , try `` end of the spear ''
