i happened to catch this movie on late night tv .
i saw the opening credits and thought this looks good .
well i was very wrong .
while not excruciatingly bad ( it had some funny and tender moments ) it lacked any sense of cohesion.it started off well enough with kathy bates'character having a midlife crisis of sorts when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered .
but kathy has played these disaffected women so well before - think fried green tomatoes .
the problem was n't kathy , it was the clueless screenplay that wandered all over the place .
it was as if the writers must have been thinking what will we do next .
the script also felt very contrived.some others who have posted comments on this movie have wondered why it did n't receive a cinematic release .
the main reason i think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered it.having said all that i thought the small woman who played maudie was fantastic and stole the movie , not to mention how beautiful she is .
