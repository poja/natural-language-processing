spike milligan was one of the funniest men i 've ever seen , and a huge influence on my life.this movie is limp and awful , and does his memory no credit .
the script is cluttered and preserves too many lines from the book intact ( the leg jokes here are incomprehensible ) .
the actors ' performances are uniformly ineffective , a great cast wasted , and the lead , sean hughes , delivers milligan 's belligerent hostilities in a plaintive whine , which misses the point completely.the gentle pacing is a killer as well .
farce should accelerate towards the end .
the goon shows often did , the novel `` puckoon '' definitely did , but this film , if anything , slows down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climax.milligan narrated an abridged audio recording of `` puckoon '' in 1980 , with t.p .
mckenna , dermot kelly , norma ronald and jack hobbs .
now , that 's funny .
ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film .
i believe the lp was transferred to cd , but do n't know if it 's still in print.there is a movie of `` adolf hitler : my part in his downfall '' with jim dale and arthur lowe .
it too is a godawful mess , but it 's funnier than this thing.it 's possible that milligan 's spirit is too rambunctious for the screen .
the other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking .
this film fumbles virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint .
