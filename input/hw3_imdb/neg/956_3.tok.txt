`` d.o.a . ''
is a non-thrilling thriller from directors rocky morton and annabeljankel .
the acting is okay and the screenplay is pretty bad .
this movie also has some moments which will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violenceare .
for example , someone is shot near a window .
we then see from outsidethe building what looks like that person jumped .
i laughed my head off when this happened .
this movie tries hard , but ultimately fails .
only watch this moviewhen you have no other choice.my critique : **rating : [ r ] rating reasons : violence and language .
**there was no rating reason available due to its age .
