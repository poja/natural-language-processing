`` witchery '' might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80 's but , luckily enough , it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects , an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices .
honestly the screenplay does n't make one iota of sense , but who cares when linda blair ( with an exploded hairstyle ) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer ( who ca n't seem to get laid ) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo , sewn-shut lips , upside down crucifixions , vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune .
eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of massachusetts .
the young couple is there to investigate the place 's dark history ; the dysfunctional family ( with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are ) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex .
they 're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways .
everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window .
anyway , the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of `` the evil dead '' .
the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film .
there 's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried .
