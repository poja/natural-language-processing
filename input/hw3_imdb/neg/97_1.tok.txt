lowe returns to the nest after , yet another , failed relationship , to find he 's been assigned to jury duty .
it 's in the plans to , somehow , get out of it , when he realizes the defendant is the girl he 's had a serious crush on since the first grade.through living in the past by telling other people about his feelings towards this girl ( played by camp ) , lowe remembers those feelings and does everything in his power to clear camp of attempted murder , while staying away from the real bad guys at the same time , and succeeding in creating a successful film at the same time.i 've heard that st augustine is the oldest city in the us , and i also know it has some ties to ponce de leon , so the backdrop is a good place to start .
unfortunately , it 's the only thing good about this movie .
the local police are inept , the judge is an idiot , and the defense counsel does everything in her power to make herself look like joanie cunningham !
i do n't know whether to blame the director for poor direction , or for just letting the cast put in such a hapless effort.in short , this movie was so boring , i could not even sleep through it !
1 out of 10 stars !
