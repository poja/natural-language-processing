this show should be titled , `` when bad writing happens to good actors '' considering most of the players have demonstrated immense talent in other venues , e.g .
andre braugher in homicide : life on the street and david morse in st. elsewhere .
i 'm hoping that the frenetic pacing of the show is adjusted as the series develops along with the obvious cliches and dialogue so absurd i wondered just how stupid the writers imagined the core audience to be .
we 're beat over the head with the main points of this show instead of being left to gradually figure it out , almost as if the writers feel that they must spell out that the main character is some sort of avenging angel , sentenced to redeem himself from sins , both venial and mortal , via butting into his cab fares many affairs .
watching the premiere required much suspension of disbelief , that mike olshanskey 's fares would so rapidly spill their guts and he would feel driven to intervene in the lives of utter strangers .
that he possesses those `` super-cop '' abilities , to be all things to all people , weapons expert , martial arts master , psychologist , father-confessor , locksmith , and so on , ad infinitum .
pure drivelesque fantasy .
what is it about recent televisions shows based in philidelphia that they all seem to be imbued with a nasty ex-wife and a very disrepectfully bratty child ?
overdone .
i wanted to like this show , really i did , because it had the virtue of having a premise slightly different than many of the clones appearing in this season 's fare and it stars some of my preferred actors .
but i 'm afraid this is just another possibly good idea ruined by careless execution .
