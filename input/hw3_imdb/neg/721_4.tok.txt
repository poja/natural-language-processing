i was loaned this dvd by the director of a film i am working with , in which i play an actor who is playing prospero .
knowing his own style , i did not expect anything resembling a `` classical '' interpretation of the text.what i have found is sometimes striking , sometimes evocative , but often meandering and tedious .
like most experimental music , i find that in films such as this , the building blocks of powerful film-making are crafted , even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format.thus we have a caliban who is more a clown than a threat , and who not even miranda seems terribly afraid of ( which is odd , since we know that he has attempted to rape her at least once ) .
a stefano and trinculo who are more annoying than funny .
an oddly young prospero who looks like amadeus .
and a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posturing.interestingly enough , i do not have an issue with the way in which ferdanand or miranda are portrayed .
his stunned rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate.i do not say that this is a bad film , but an experimental one .
one that takes huge risks , but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in the tempest for its own sake .
