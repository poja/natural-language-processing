this is possibly the worst movie i 've ever seen , it was horribly done it did n't flow it was very choppy , because of that many people did n't understand the movie at all .
i had to watch this movie several times before i got an idea about what was happening , ok its like this a kid stole someones car and while running from the police he totals it , for some reason the cops let him off and he has to face his parents who sent him to live with his uncle out in the wilderness , there he meets a girl who loves to rock climb and he gets into the sport and has to beg his uncle to let him enter a contest for climbing , and yeah thats about it like i said horrible movie .
