wow .
not because of the 3-d imagery , which at times was used nicely to provide good deep imagery , but what a lame ending !
the end of the movie just seems to implode on itself .
this film has got to be one of the goofiest movie monsters ever and one of the most pathetic attempts to try to explain it .
the misogyny of this film is painful as well .
if you are looking for a bad 50s sci-fi film to laugh at ( aka 'bot fodder ) , go for it .
otherwise , look for better films .
