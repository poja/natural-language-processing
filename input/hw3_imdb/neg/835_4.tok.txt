any gun can play ( 2 outta 5 stars ) totally routine `` spaghetti western '' starring that guy who used to play `` kookie '' on `` 77 sunset strip '' .
the plot is some convoluted nonsense about some stolen gold coins and various gunmen of dubious motivation trying to track it down .
this is one of those `` lighthearted '' westerns ... which means lots of labored attempts at `` comedy '' ... and some really atrocious music during most of the action sequences ( you can tell this is n't ennio morricone 's work ) .
george hilton plays a bounty hunter called `` stranger '' ... but he does n't leave much of an impression ... he just does n't have the style of clint eastwood or franco nero , who are able to do a lot with a sparsely-written character .
the ending is a complete homage/parody of the ending of `` the good , the bad and the ugly '' ... though it 's barely amusing enough to be considered a `` parody '' .
the highlight of the movie is the first 5 minutes ... which features actors patterned after clint eastwood , lee van cleef and someone else ( is he supposed to be eli wallach ?
franco nero ?
it 's not very clear ... ) who are confronted by stranger .
it 's an amusing in-joke for fans of sergio leone fans and spaghetti western aficionados ... but i imagine no one else would see the point .
