this movie was recommended to me by some academics .
from their comments , i had some pretty lofty expectations .
but this movie was nothing but disappointing .
the aim of the director is obvious -- to use an interweaving of speeches/poems as a way to argue against the bush doctrine .
but the director fails miserably at this .
also i seriously question the director 's choice of main character .
it 's a bum who is definitely not worthy of being heard .
the rise of corporation power , so what ?
most importantly , this movie gets a failing score in its persuasive power ; it 's clearly intended for those who 've already formed their opinions .
it 's true that the movie 's aesthetics are quite pleasing .
but pretty much everything else in the movie simply sucks .
