i have absolutely no idea why i watched ali g indahouse except for the fact that salon seemed to think a crime was committed by not nominating sacha baron cohen for a emmy for his work on da ali g show .
it is a sure bet that i will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie .
comedy ?
torture was more like it .
it was just about the stupidest thing i every watched .
i will admit that i was captivated by rhona mitra .
i had not seen her in anything .
she was n't on the practice during the time i was watching , so i guess i will have to check out boston legal one of these evenings to see how she does in something that may be worth watching .
