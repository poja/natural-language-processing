the kid was born retarded .
it pulls in a half-dozen directions , features dialog and action lifted from much older and better-known flops , and might be funny -- if only the writers knew what funny is.disney stuff has gotten a lot better in the last couple of decades , but do n't let that fool you .
they should have given the kid a wide berth , sang it a lullaby , then ran the train into a ravine .
mercy killing .
