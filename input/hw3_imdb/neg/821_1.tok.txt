i had already heard of ali g in madonna 's music video `` music '' .
i always think he 's funny .
( in fact , he really is . )
just last year i always thought of buying a vcd of `` ali g indahouse '' .
that 's why some months later , i bought it cheap and i started watching it.but the movie surprised me .
my older brother and i were expecting it to be a great laugh-out comedy .
it turns out that `` indahouse '' is just a stupid piece of garbage .
it was really really bad .
it also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor .
it also did n't made me laugh , even just a big smile .
we definitely hate that movie .
oh by the way , i have plans to sell it.ali g was really different in his movie compared to his tv shows -- in such a negative way .
maybe he was n't really well-focused and enough serious to make this flick .
just because there 's some sex scenes in it does n't mean it 's freaking hilarious ( because sometimes , too much is n't that laughable anymore ) .
for the first time ever , i was disappointed at him .
that really made me sad rather and happy.i gave this movie 1 over 10. actually , i really want to give it a 0 rating .
it 's one of the worst movies i 've seen in my entire life .
i would n't recommend to anyone who wan na watch good comedies that are n't too explicit or horrible .
