i actually was looking forward to this movie .
after reading a number of reviews before the release , it sounded like a genuinely nice film , one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting cast ( nicholas cage , penelope cruz and john hurt . )
well , it might have been all of those things but it is so boring that i defy almost anyone to sit through this in its entirety and keep attention .
also , cage 's attempt at speaking with an italian accent is embarrassingly bad .
he 's such a good actor that i cringed every time he spoke in this film .
'disappointing '' seems to be the most-often word used by reviewers here to describe this film , and i totally agree.i guess it did n't take long for word to get out about how bad this movie was because , like cage 's accent , it did not do well .
