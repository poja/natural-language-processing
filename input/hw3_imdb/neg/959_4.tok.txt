interesting plot but painfully dull .
the script lacks ... lacks acting .
to me this film compares with `` made for tv '' type movies .
i was lucky to survive the film without falling asleep in my popcorn .
i watched this film with my family .
it is fairly safe to watch with your kids .
( only 1 semi sex scene ) if you wish to see a young meg ryan ... check out this movie .
very 80-ish .
you will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at christmas , booze , super glue and tar .
or maybe you are like me ... and have have a higher standard for acting in films .
however i did like the way the movie began and ended !
mark .
