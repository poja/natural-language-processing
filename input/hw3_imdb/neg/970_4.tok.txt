eddy murphy and robert de niro should be a combination that results in a great comedy .
great expectationa often lead to dissapointment , and this proves to be the case.when eddy as a police officer spoils a drug deal being done by detective robert , they botch it so badly that they end up doing a live action reality tv cop show .
logic is not a great component of this movie .
the super-gun that they spend the second half of the movie chasing down confirms it .
a twelve guage machine gun that leaves large holes in sheetmetal and three will destroy a house in about a minute ( without reloading ) is as more a fantasy than science fiction .
a five pound gun , firing hundreds of shots per minute without any recoil , is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the past.it is clear this movie was designed for neither adults nor children , so if you are somewhere in between , this is the movie for you .
