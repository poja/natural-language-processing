the cinemascope color cinematography of leon shamroy is quite remarkable here , including his use of colored filters forvarious scenes .
the alfred newmann score has to be the most sensual and seductive score hollywood ever produced .
it 's a shame it is no longer available on cd .
the actors , however , never rise to the occasion .
the accents are so varied , from the subdued british of ustinov and purdom to the hollywood of baxter and mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision .
tommy rettig is jarringly american .
acting styles span the range from zombie-like to stilted .
only ustinov as a conniving one-eyed servant steals the show - what there is of it to steal .
the premise - the story of a young egyptian doctor , seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the single god , ra - persecuted by the authorities , has its interesting points .
but when the film 's plot fades , it is the haunting music and visuals that remain .
