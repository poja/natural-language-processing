this is a truly awful film .
lou diamond phillips simply calls this one in .
the use of miniature models of the train are laughable .
the plot seems to develop on the run ( there is an alien on board ; oh , and an eco-terrorist is on board too ; oh , and the conductor is dead and the train is out of control ; oh , and the train is going to run into another train one hour ahead ; oh , and that train has nuclear waste on it ... ) .
i mean , come on really !
the alien monsters are not scary ( although there are a lot of them ) , and the acting is abysmal .
check out the guy playing the `` next president '' - do you really think he could be president ?
for goodness sake , he has spent his whole acting career playing bad guys !
