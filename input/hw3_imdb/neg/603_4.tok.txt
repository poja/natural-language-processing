i found this movie to be mostly a p.o.s.it was low budget , but that is n't the problem.the problem is , the movie is just lame.it does n't really make a lot of sense.yes , it does explain why things happened , but that 's not what i mean.there was just no reason for it all.the movie also moved very slow.the last ice age was quicker than this.also , i think they went overboard a bit in the kills.i do n't mean they were too gross , but the killer just seemed to spend too much time smashing his victim over the head , or stabbing his victim .
maybe i 'm being petty , but i just did n't like the movie.the whole thing seemed like a lower rate version of `` when a stranger calls '' and maybe that was the whole point.but so what.for me `` when a stranger kills '' is a 4/10*
