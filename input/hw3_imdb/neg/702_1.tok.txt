this is one of the worst films i 've ever seen , do n't watch it even if your life depends on it.this laurel and hardy film is when they inherit an island , become shipwrecked and are set to be hung .
an incredibly boring film that is no where near funny.this was the last laurel and hardy film and what a very low note to end such a superb career .
the 40 's films were n't great , this film was made in 1950. if you want to remember laurel and hardy , remember them in their prime , the 1930 's .
the short talking films are better than the feature length films , my favourite is `` me and my pal '' .
another reason this film is awful is because it 's dubbed .
the actor opens there mouth and the words come out three days later .
absoulutley crap , but let 's end on a high note , laurel and hardy have been , in my opinion , the best double act ever .
