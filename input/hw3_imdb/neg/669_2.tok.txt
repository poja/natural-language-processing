ho humm - - - more of nothing .
if you are a long-time rush fan you know what this video contains : loathsome songs from the past , the `` big 3 '' hits from the 80 's and their `` last-ditch '' efforts to remain contemporary .
they do succeed in making fun of themselves by beating the critics to the punch by portraying themselves as `` dinosaurs . ''
unfortunately , they fail at protecting themselves from embarrassment .
close-ups of their faces only add to the fact that these guys have been.if you are have been following ( as much as you can stomach ) the band for a couple of decades from the 70 's , then you know there is no new material here .
same old , same old : 1 ) neil avoids the press , 2 ) no real behind-the-scenes ( geddy looses his shoes ?
!
give me a break !
even he thinks it 's absurd ! )
3 ) no new insights.a better video would have been to show the crew setting up for 3 or 4 hours  just let the camera run .
and stop changing camera angles every 2 seconds !
i understand the director wants to try to do something artsy .
but then offer a full concert version of 2 or 3 shots the viewer can choose .
we know what the band looks like  let us see what we really want to see.do yourself a big favor : rent this movie first .
