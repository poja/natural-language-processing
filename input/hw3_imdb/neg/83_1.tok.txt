now i understand that this took two months to shoot .
really ?
i 'm pretty certain my crew could do it in less than a week .
this movie sucked so bad i could n't even pay close attention .
just more proof that boob bearing women ca n't always save you from horrible writing , acting and direction .
now i understand it was a no budget endeavor , but there is also no continuity and no real reason to not to turn it off and watch infomercials or foreign news in a language you do n't understand .
oh , there are a few decent looking females showing the goods .
still , there are n't enough sexy women alive to warrant watching this travesty perpetrated on the film industry .
one of the longest 80 minutes of my life .
i trooped it out though with the help of my old friend jim beam .
do yourself a favor and get your gun ready cuz you may want to use it after this hack job .
lastly , the individual ( moron ) who left a comment before mine thought this was a great movie and loved it .
just more proof that siblings should n't pro-create .
ow , burn !
