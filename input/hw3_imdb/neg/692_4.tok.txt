*possible spoilers ahead*i 'll only say what has n't already been said here ( and i 'll continue this for the rest of my wwf/wwe comments ) .if you 're going to have a women 's title match , at least make it interesting , rather than just a squash to put over the current champion .
i guess moolah could n't handle an intense match but they wanted to have the legend in a wrestlemania.i thought the killer bees were wasted in wrestlemanias , especially here .
i became a fan in 1989 , about a year after the b. brian blair was gone and jim brunzell became a canvas back .
so i did n't realize for a while that they were a top tag team , even top contenders.but i loved seeing bill fralic in the battle royal .
he really came into his own here , creating a cocky heel character in a pre-match interview and even making an elimination in the battle royal .
besides steve mcmichael and kevin greene , he is the only professional athlete from my generation with any respect for wrestling ( anyone remember dennis rodman ? )
.
and what was with the hart foundation 's ridiculous green tights ?
