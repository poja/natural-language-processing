at a saturday matinee in my home town .
i went with an older friend ( he was about 12 ) and my mom let me go because she thought the film would be ok ( it 's rated g ) .
i was assaulted by loud music , strange images , no plot and a stubborn refusal to make any sense .
we left halfway through because we were bored , frustrated and our ears hurt .
i saw it 22 years later in a revival theatre .
my opinion had changed -- it 's even worse !
basically everything i hated about it was still there and the film was very 60s ... and has dated badly .
i got all the little in-jokes ... too bad they were n't funny .
the constant shifts in tone got quickly annoying and there 's absolutely nothing to get a firm grip on .
some people will love this .
i found it frustrating ... by the end of the film i felt like throwing something heavy at the screen.also , all the monkees songs in this movie suck ( and i do like them ) .for ex-hippies only ... or if you 're stoned .
i give this a 1 .
