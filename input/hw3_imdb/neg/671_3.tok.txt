i am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive .
having read the book several times ( and all the other historical novels by mika waltari ) there is no way to say much good in this film .
if i forget the origins of the story i might consider it a reasonably good epic .
of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied , but it could be done with class .
i ca n't understand why even the name of nefernefernefer had to be shortened to just nefer .
i love peter ustinov as kaptah and marlon brando probably would have made a better sinuhe but the overall attitude is too hollywood to ever make justice to the book .
mind you mika waltari left the premier of this film in the middle of the showing .
that 's how much he liked it .
