quite possibly one of ( if not the ) worst film ever conceived , cast and acted in the history of cinema .
who on god 's green earth would ever think to cast cameron diaz and james mardsen as a couple ?
she looked like his mother .
god forgive me but i am just being honest .
and that was the least of the many problems plaguing this horrible excuse for a film .
it was a horrible statement against women but at least if you 're gon na blame women for the problems of the world , tell a decent story not one with so many annoying loop holes and pathetic excuses for suspense and thrills .
everybody should get their money back who went to see it in theaters or bought the dvd .
