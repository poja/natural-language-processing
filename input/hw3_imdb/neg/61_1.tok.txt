i and a friend rented this movie .
we both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging .
the movie 's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending .
we both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot .
