little did i know that when i signed up the the `` all pay channel '' package with direct tv that i would face a movie like this .
it came on right after another movie we had been watching ... and i was a teenager in 1981 so am not sure where i was at the time ... but i missed this movie.i also ca n't believe we left it on .
it is kind-of funny as it takes you back in the time machine to the early 80s ... but i think even then this would have been a painful movie .
it was just ... well ... `` too cute '' !
et was `` cute '' in a way ... but not obnoxiously cute ... and stupid.when i see a movie like this ... i come on onto imdb to see what others say .
i am blown away that this thing was nominated !
wow ... the movie industry has come a long way since the 80s !
oh well ... it did show some old actors ... btw that is the other thing i was surprised about ... the lineup ... not a bunch of no-names ... but some real actors/actresses .
must have been in their drug days !
anyways ... odd , interesting , bizarre , and makes one happy they grew up !
