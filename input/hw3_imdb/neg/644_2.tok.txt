some plot spoilers ahead.the nashville network 's so-called rebirth as `` the first network for men '' is a complete disappointment , as was its block of adult cartoons .
the new ren and stimpy was just plain awful , `` gary the rat '' mediocre at best , and `` stripperella '' pretty unwatchable .
this cartoon is mostly boring ; if `` ren and stimpy '' suffered from gross-out overkill , `` stripperella '' lacked any decent shock gags , funny witless gags , clever gags , or gags , period .
the concept is bad to begin with : pamela anderson , a stripper-cum-superheroine , saves `` the city '' from an assortment of goofy supervillains .
this cartoon seems like an homage to superior wacky superhero spoofs , like `` darkwing duck '' and `` the tick , '' but without those cartoons ' wit and good writing -- -or even good storyboarding .
`` agent 0069 '' tries to vacillate between being goofy and sexy , but she is neither , and this cartoon 's failure to make her one or the other brings this series down.watch your taped episodes of `` the tick , '' and see what a real superhero spoof cartoon is like .
