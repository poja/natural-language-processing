awful , dreadful , terrible .
the actors are bad , the music is ridiculous and the filming pathetic .
i rented the dvd and had to force myself to watch it until the end.my advice : read the book , it is much better and you wo n't have to put up with all these silly images and ridiculous dreams catherine has.i think i have never watched such a bad movie .
