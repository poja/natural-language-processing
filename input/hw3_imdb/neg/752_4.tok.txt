normally bbc productions of jane austen are pretty good but northanger abbey is just odd .
what were they thinking ?
this film has little of austen 's charm and ironically mimics the gothic novels that austen so wonderfully mocked .
not only that , the `` gothic '' sequences are tacky , over-the-top , and frankly silly .
the actress playing miss morland is poorly cast with no obvious appeal to attract the attentions of an eligible bachelor , and though i rather liked the creepy peter firth as mr. tilney , he is not a bit like the novel , even when delivering dialog straight out of the book .
robert hardy as general tilney turned in one of his few terribly `` ham '' performances .
this film was so bizarre and strange that i actually watched it again just to savor how freakishly wrong it was .
