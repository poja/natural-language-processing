i am a huge robert taylor fan and i have been trying to find all of his films .
this is one i did not have , but i watched it recently on fox movie channel , and was very disappointed .
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts , but the acting was as bad as the script .
victor mclaglen was even bad , and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable .
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck , it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them .
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous : that the president of the u.s. would order a navy lt to leave the service secretly to hunt down bank robbers , and report only to the president , that it made it hard to appreciate anything else about the film .
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving .
the only thing worse than taylor 's acting was stanwyck 's singing .
she got better later in ball of fire-thank heavens .
