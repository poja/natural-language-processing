my wife and i saw this in the theater when it first came out.there were only 3 couples there and we all walked out about the same time.this is the only movie i have ever walked out on.it was just painful to sit through.the theater actually stopped us on the way out and asked if we wanted a refund.never had that happen before or since pleae do not rent this you will really regret it i am really sureprised by the vote summary perhaps personal tast has something to do with it
