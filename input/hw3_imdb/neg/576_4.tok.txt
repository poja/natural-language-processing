this film is about a mysterious love letter that turned 4 people 's love life upside down.the idea of the film is interesting , and the film could have been funny .
however , this film is simply what a romantic comedy should not be .
the characters are inadequately introduced at first , so it gets so confusing .
the supporting characters come and go without adequate reasons , as if they exist just for one particular scene and then vanish into thin air .
the pacing is awfully slow , that it makes 90 minutes seem more like 180 minutes.it could have been romantic and funny , but this film spectacularly failed to do either .
