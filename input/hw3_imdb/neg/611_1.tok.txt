i am very diplomatic in my reviews , and as an academic writer , try to give creative license to tv writers trying to explicate a true story .
this story , about karen carpenter , could have helped so many , yet due to the directing and editing , does not.the story , in this case , is not fully addressed , unless one reads psychological journals .
while cynthia gibb portrays a realistic karen , it is sad that so much has been edited ... louise fletcher portrays her mother , and does an excellent job , with limited material and dialogue .
in this case , i give the actors credit for surviving this project.why is the audience not permitted to see causation factors ?
... .american audiences are quite savvy , and if they have cable , usually educated.i sincerely feel that i could have written a better story , would not have edited out the truth , and allowed the actors to project the reality.richard carpenter , as director , has seriously underestimated and insulted american audiences .
karen 's story is important , and it is sad we will never hear it .
