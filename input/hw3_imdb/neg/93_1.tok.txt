i quite enjoyed the wrecking crew ( 1999 ) , which was the last of the three films in this series ( the first being urban menace ( 1999 ) which i 've yet to see ) .
i know it was baaaaad , but the three leads did a pretty decent job , all things considered.this , however , was truly atrocious .
ice-t was dreadful , and he 's the producer !
ca n't say i 've ever heard of silkk the shocker ( who apparently never learnt how to spell ) , but his performance was one of the worst i 've ever seen in a movie.miss jones did pretty well in her small role , though she later went on to make some atrocious , racist `` jokes '' on her radio show after the se asian tsunami ( plus other occasions sadly ) .
way to go , girl ... no-one else comes out with any credit .
strangely , tj storm and ernie hudson ( who are both pretty bad here ) are far better in the wrecking crew , which was made , along with urban menace , at the same time as corrupt .
how that works , i do n't know.i 'm going to try the ice-t commentary now , to see whether he apologises for the film , or tries to make us think it 's a great piece of film-making .
