sometimes , changes to novels when they 're made into films are not only necessary , but a good thing .
however , in the case of northanger abbey , it 's a very , very bad thing .
not only is the story itself ripped to shreds , but the satire is almost completely absent from the film , and it 's mixture of romance and intrigue does n't even touch upon the biting commentary that austen put into her work .
it fails to be amusing or satirical at all , and instead turns the character 's fascination with her fantasy world into mostly a drama.this affects the romance as well .
it 's meandering and aimless .
chemistry and interest are never established .
the reasons tilney is attracted to catherine are completely absent from the film , leaving the audience to wonder what it is he sees in her at all.hopefully some day soon , we 'll get a more faithful version if austen 's satire .
