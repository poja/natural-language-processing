this is absolutely awful .
it 's everywhere & nowhere & does n't have any sort of point .
i have never understood what is good about jeff garlin or sarah silverman .
bonnie hunt is so above this drivel she must have been personal friends w/people involved because there is no way she would have read any part of this so-called `` script '' & thought , `` yeah i wan na do that ! ''
most movies i can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or funny .
there is zero of that in this .
it 's extremely dumb .
there really is n't any other word to describe this .
this is quite possibly the biggest waste of money on making of film that i have seen in a long time .
skip this at all cost , you 'll be glad you did .
