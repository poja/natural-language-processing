honestly awful film , bad editing , awful lighting , dire dialog and scrappy screenplay.the lighting at is so bad there 's moments you ca n't even see what 's going on , i even tried to playing with the contrast and brightness so i could see something but that did n't help.they must have found the script in a bin , the character development is just as awful and while you hardly expect much from a jean-claude van damme film this one manages to hit an all time low .
you ca n't even laugh at the cheesy'ness.the directing and editing are also terrible , the whole film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every turn as it bumbles through the plot that is so weak it 's just unreal.there 's not a lot else to say other than it 's really bad and nothing like jean-claude van damme 's earlier work which you could enjoy.avoid like the plaque , frankly words fail me in condemning this `` film '' .
