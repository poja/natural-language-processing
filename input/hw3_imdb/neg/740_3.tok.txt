( this might have a spoiler ) when i first started watching this movie , i thought it was ok. the music was good and that bizarro dream sequence i was willing to forgive , but the lack of looks in the main character and all of the other characters for that matter made me uninterested in watching the rest of this film .
( i know , totally vain . )
the music at the beginning was spirited and fitting i thought for a mock gothic novel .
but , come on !
saxophone music for an early 19th century film ?
it totally did n't fit .
this movie was totally boring and if you 're looking to watch a good period film or an austen do n't rent northanger abbey !
i give it a 30 % .
30 % = a failing grade !
