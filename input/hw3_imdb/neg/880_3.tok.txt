frankly , after cotton club and unfaithful , it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film , because it is bad .
the acting was bad , the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere .
it was well shot , but , then again , it is a big budget movie .
it was too predictable , even for a chick flick .
i even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end , the only thing i did n't know was how .
too politically correct .
very disappointing .
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house , because it is beautiful .
but , if you want that , watch national geographic .
i love lane , but i 've never seen her in a movie this lousy .
as far as gere goes , he 's a good actor , but he had movies like this , so i 'm not surprised .
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back .
