i had no idea this movie was produced by `` wwe '' .
wrestling is lame enough .
why did they have to soil their name further by making a movie as crappy as this one was ?
?
i found it to be a complete disappointment .
if i had of known this movie was going to be as stupid as it was , i would have stayed home and done something more entertaining .
sure , i 'll give them the credit of the cool effects ; but the killer did n't seem as scary as he could have been .
he lacked a number of things .
but i 'll let you point them out for yourselves .
the plot was a great idea , just could have been done in a much better way .
maybe in the future , wwe will stick to its moronic wrestling and stay out of the film industry..
