if i compare two films with sacha cohen , borat and ali g then ali g is immeasurably better .
i'ts no master piece , but it 's a film at least .
borat is complete garbage and i do not understand how it rated better then ali g.i can not put my finger on it , there something wrong with the ali g script : half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old , not by an adult scriptwriter .
and a number of jokes including mr cohen 's lower body are quite tasteless .
but the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny : such as how ali g becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public ( sadly true in today 's western society : people get careers for doing stupid things in public ) , also ali 's advice about immigrant policy and some others .
ali g overall remains a sympathetic character , even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age .
but it 's ok to watch , it 's quite funny.but never ever watch borat , it 's awful and makes every intelligent movielover sick .
