i am truly sad that this is the first bad review i 've ever made for a movie ... ever.i could stand to watch this movie , and it is the second movie in all the movies i 've seen that is just ... a downgrade .
the first is open water , that just had no point whatsoever .
the next karate kid did n't have any mention of daniel ( correct me if i 'm wrong , please . )
, and that ending line came as a shock .
it was like , `` if must fight ... win . ''
then it showed the bird flying around and the pan flute was playing , and i was like , oh .
okay , so it 'll take a while for this next part .
and then the credits hit the screen.geez man !
!
hopefully , i will never have to review a movie in a bad manner again , i apologize for those of you who like the next karate kid , i really , really do ...
