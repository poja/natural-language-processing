do n't tell me this film was funny or a little funny .
it was a complete disaster , and one of the worst movies i 've ever seen .
ali g is only funny on channel 4 's ali g show .
after watching his performance , all i can say is he is not made for movies .
with a daft script , or more like no storyline , there 's nothing to keep you entertained .
full of annoying , unrealistic character 's this movie is a complete garbage all the way .
at the end of the film , ali g gives a speech .
he mentions , if you hated this film , tell people it was good .
not even the speech could save the movie , he probably knew its gon na be a stinker .
i would of given this a 0/10 , but the minimum start is 1. overall , do n't even waste your time on this rubbish .
