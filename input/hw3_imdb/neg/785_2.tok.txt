`` do n't be greedy '' sums up the depth of this movie .
all the rest of the baloney is big budget window dressing .
the movie rotates through hiding the ball annoyingly and revealing too much .
none of the potentially interesting plot tangents are developed yet the trite ones are hashed and rehashed to excess.the charm of dd , as others have pointed out , was in the schizophrenia device , the humor woven into the fabric of the movie , and most importantly , the acting .
there is enough wooden acting in the box to attract a giant mound of martian termites.the biggest problem with suspending disbelief during this mess is the glaring question , `` why would a technologically superior power capable of taking over the government need to do any testing at all ? ''
awful failure of a movie .
