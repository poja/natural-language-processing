the first 4 episodes of season 6 are just to throw up , to predictable and the worst scenario i 've seen .
wo n't and hopefully i di n't buy it .
also seen in seasons back that episodes about space they did , suck even more .
all i want to say to the people who make this is : do n't do whole episode about space , because they suck .
the point is that season 6 sucks even more than the seasons before .
gets worse from season to season .
i got so disappointed and frustrated watching first 4 episodes of season 6 that i just had to write this .
only people who are brain washed can watch this crap .
seems that people writing the scenario are getting out of ideas for a long time .
think that my 2 year old nephew had a better idea for the episode than these people do .
