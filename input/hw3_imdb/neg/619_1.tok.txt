one of the worst things a film studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others , commercializing a 'shock ' or 'gore ' factor in order to sell tickets to be able to buy their birch a new diamond necklace .
another worst thing is to totally misrepresent the true facts of an incredible saga by fabricating events , dialog and images to the director 's own liking .
lastly , one of the worst things a film studio can do is to use bottom-of-the-barrel actors and shoot it all on a sound stage that was rented for fifty cents a day .
all three of these travesties the makers of this film are guilty of .
this is , hands-down , the worst movie i have ever seen , and i 've seen thousands .
a score of '1 ' is too good for this waste of celluloid .
not only should the filmmakers be ashamed for making it , they should be ashamed for negatively exploiting the heroes of this story , which are the people who experienced this tragedy firsthand , both the living and the dead .
