i 've become a big fan of the carpenters , and i did n't really enjoy this movie.i feel it focused far too much on her anorexia and did n't let her true personality shine through .
i was n't overly fond of cynthia gibb 's portrayal ; especially knowing she decided karen 's anorexia was suicide , which it clearly was n't .
although her family was not big on hugs and kisses , i thought the movie portrayed agnes ( their mother ) as being terrible.i did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way , such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier ; i thought the metaphor ( so-to-speak ) there was rather effective .
when the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her frail body was pretty moving ( which is probably the wrong word ) as well.overall , i feel they needed to bring out her more bubbly , quirky side -- her genuine personality .
even as the focus of the film , there really was n't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia ( though of course no one can really know ) , and almost made it seem baseless .
the film was more poor-singer-with-anorexia than karen carpenter 's story , in my opinion.i would assume that they changed her husband 's name/profession and all because they could n't get his permission to actually include him ( there were some bad terms there ) , but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes .
on this note , i ca n't recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids , which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband.on the whole , it ends up as a low-budget made-for-tv movie that just is n't very high quality and can be disappointing if you 're a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond karen 's disease .
i feel that such a legend deserves/deserved a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice .
