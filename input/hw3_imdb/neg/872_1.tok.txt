we thought this was one of the worst movies ever .
i had to volunteer to watch the end .
the romance was not believable ; the characters were not developed ; the love affair made hardly any sense ; it was miscast ; and scenery was absolutely stupid because it was either ( my opinion ) like the adams family goes on vacation ... just creepy , gypsy and cheesy ; and the outerbanks does not look typically like those houses on the surf ; and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it was not theirs .
also..it was not realistic .
hurrricanes give you plenty of notice to batten down the hatches.also the friend was superfluous ; and did not match the story what did the civil war have to do with the outerbanks anyway ?
i also have to mention the wardrobe ... did d. lane have to have a scarf/pashmina/shawl on in every scene ?
it was overdone .
she looked good enough to not have to hide things ; without making them obvious like with light slacks.lastly i am concerned with the impact on our landfills when everyone has to dispose of this stupid , and i mean stupid movie !
