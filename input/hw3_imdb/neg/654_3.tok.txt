okay , this movie starts out and it *looks* like it 's going to be a cute comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan .
she has no touch with reality whatsoever outside of the soap ( sort of the inverse of the main characters in `` pleasantville '' ) and runs away to los angeles to meet a fictional character .
well it is a cute movie ... but at the same time , it is also a dark , very violent movie about two hitmen who are out to kill betty for reasons way to complex to recount here .
either plotline would have been enough on it 's own , but `` nurse betty '' contains both stories at once , and the effect is very jarring .
i did n't much enjoy it .
