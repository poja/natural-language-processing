black and white satire of a madison avenue ad agency being taken over by blacks .
they 're headed by putney swope ( arnold johnson ) who is determined to change things .
however he turns out to be even worse than his white predecessors .
that 's about as original as this gets.i 'm sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today .
the jokes are either unfunny ( the president is a midget .
how is this funny ? )
, cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters .
it 's done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to take ... or understand .
the movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along .
the ending comes out of nowhere .
to make it worse , with the sole exception of johnson , all the acting is bad .
antonio fargas ( a regular in these types of films ) is especially annoying as the arab .
this gets three stars because the commercial parodies ( done in bright color ) are amusing and there 's a rare good line here and there .
i heard this was a cult classic but this is more interesting than good .
skip it ... unless you 're in experimental 1960s films .
