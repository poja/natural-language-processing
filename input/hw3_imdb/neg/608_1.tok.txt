this is a lame comedy.here 's why : a man and wife sitcom .
okay.the husband is a douche bag .
the wife is the einstein.how original is that ?
jerry stiller is just the same guy on seinfeld.the gags are lame .
no witty one-liners.i have had enough .
stop this now.the last word : stupid .
the destruction of the average white guy continues on abc .
the worst part ?
kevin james is actually a funny comedian .
he just is n't here .
leah remini is great eye candy , but is unlikeable .
wasted talent is the word .
bad sitcom .
