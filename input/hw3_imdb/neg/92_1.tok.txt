this film has no plot , no good acting , to be honest it has nothing , the same songs play over and over awful acting and if you can actually sit there and watch the whole thing and enjoy it there is something wrong with you .
i wish i could give this 0 out of 10 but i cant so it has to be a 1 which is generous !
ice-t is n't even a good rapper and even worse at acting , every bit of the film is rubbish , i got this film on dvd without knowing what it was for the price of Â£1.99 and thought that i had picked up a bargain , i then looked at the imdb rating and did n't take it into consideration but after watching it found out that the dvd i had bought was a complete waste of time , money and electricity .
if you have this film there are two things you can do sell it to someone who does n't know about it or burn it !
