i like all different types of movies , so this is not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes the matrix etc etc.i just felt it was a lousy movie .
i do n't feel that there was enough buildup of the characters to fall in love .
they were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe hurricane and major issues in each of their lives , richard gere and diane lane fall hopelessly and helplessly in love ?
?
it is n't realistic .
this movie did n't make me buy into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot .
some emotional connection .
if someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly , without any true substance , than so be it .
you are neither right or wrong .
different strokes for different folks.another very unbelievable component to the movie was diane lane 's very rude teenage daughter becoming nice and sympathetic at the end of the movie .
does a teenage girl who is that miserable and aggravated at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice ?
this movie , in a nutshell , had some big names , but to me , was a major disappointment .
