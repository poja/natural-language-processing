this is by far the most vapid , idiotic , insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air , and this is coming from someone who remembers `` san pedro beach bums '' .my wife loves watching reality shows -- and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a `` walk '' .
the end result was straight out of monty python 's `` ministry of silly walks '' sketch .
i could n't laugh hard enough.and then there 's the ubiquitous ms. banks ( as in laughing all the way to the ... ) .
she has to be the most annoying self-important woman on tv since rosie o'donnell left `` the view '' .
as if modeling was doing great things for mankind .
please .
i 've never found her attractive , and i do n't find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth.someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women .
