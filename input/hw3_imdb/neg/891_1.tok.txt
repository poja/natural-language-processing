i too am a house party fan ... house party i is my favorite movie of all times .
house party 4 is a disgrace to all of the hp 's and to kid n play ... this was supposed to be part of a series really..there was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans..yea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a house party movie b/c its kind of focused on teens..but kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance ... you can tell how good it was b/c it did n't even make it to the movie theaters .
immature was in house party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacy ... but they should have represented right ... they should have left it at house party 3. i am 27 years old and i have been watching house party i since i was 11 when it came out in 1990 ( 16 years ago ) and i have been a fan ever since .
when i first seen house party 4 i was like what are they really thinking about ... there was nothing familiar about this movie that would compare to the previous 3 movies.. i thought it was a black ferris bueller days off .
