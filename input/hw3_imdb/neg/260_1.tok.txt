k murli mohan rao made the much better bandhan in 1998 this film is an awful remake of the wedding singerbasically in short , the film consists of : salman khan who in those days used to have the role of a dejected lover who looses his girl and also he had his comic scenes where he hammed badly even today he does well he does it all here too and also looses his shirt in scenesjackie shroff- wasted , bored and tired , his role is so stupid he is shown as a lover of pooja bhatra then in 1 scene he is shown as a womanizer ?
