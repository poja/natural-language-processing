seriously , i ca n't imagine how anyone could find a single flattering thing to say about this movie , much less find it in themselves to write the glowing compliments contained in this comment section .
how many methamphetamines was bogdonovitch on during the filming of this movie ?
was he giving a bonus to the actor that spat his lines out with the most speed and least inflection or thought ?
the dialogue is bad , the plot atrocious , even for a `` screwball '' comedy , and claims that the movie is an homage to classic film comedy is about the most inane thing i 've ever heard .
the cinematography is below the quality and innovation of that exhibited by the worst made-for-tv movies , the acting is awful ( although i get the feeling that the fault for that lies squarely in the lap of the director ) , and speaking of which , did i mention the direction is so haphazard and inscrutable that it defies the definition of the word ?
the whole thing is a terribly unfunny ( even in the much-beleaguered world of so-bad-it's-funny clunkers ) , soul-sucking , waste of two hours of your life that you 'll never get back .
be afraid , be very afraid ...
