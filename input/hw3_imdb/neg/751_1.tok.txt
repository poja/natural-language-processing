is it possible to give a 0 out of 10 rating ?
because this one deserves it .
while i 'm not a big fan of jane austen 's books , i sat through this one with two women who are .
well , at least we had a big laugh about how bad this film is .
robert hardy was the only actor with any charisma in the whole thing , though he overdid it as he usually does ( nearly as bad as william shatner ) .
but that was n't enough to save this stinker from total suckitude .
it 's often hard to separate the girl 's dream sequences from what is `` really '' happening , and so many holes are left in the story that you can barely figure out what is going on .
too many loose ends and the ending feels like a `` tune in again next week '' climax .
the lead actress is too ditsy and weird-looking to be a heroine , the leading man is too goofy-looking and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some kind of cheap new-agey pet project of the director 's hippy daughter ( i mean saxophone ?
?
?
mixed in with some kind of spacey operatic female wailing ? )
.
so , in conclusion , i suggest you blow the budget and order a dvd of this one as soon as possible .
especially if you like disappointment .
