this is an absolutely horrid excuse for a show .
people say its witty and intelligence ?
i do n't see how ?
maybe because the characters use fancy words ?
maybe because they are snooty , use dry humor , and have 2 dimensional personalities .
i went to an ivy league school and nobody acted anywhere near as obnoxious as these characters .
in fact had i met someone like them i would have likely strangled them !
the men act like little emotional pre-teen girls and all the minority characters are based off stereotypes ... the characters are no at all authentic .
simply put they sound like a trailer park family trying to be rich and sophisticated .
this show is just another cookie-cutter hit that brain-dead prime time viewers eat up on a regular basis .
