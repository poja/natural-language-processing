a movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on its ear should be fun , romantic and easy-going entertainment .
instead this movie is more about things not said and not expressed , so it gets to the point where you are grateful anything is said at all , even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable .
spoiler -- when the relationship that says the most is the one least seen on the screen ( danner and mcewan ) , you know you 're in trouble .
but those two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie screaming for some genuine people.end of spoilercapshaw is given the task of creating a character from not much and she is not entirely successful .
like i said above , the theme seems to be repression and i understand that is an element of life and love but i do n't want to see a movie about it either , at least not this one .
i ca n't recommend this at all , despite the very talented cast who are left to fend for themselves .
