nothing special to see here , the animation has being outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era .
this film has an original story , but if it does n't have an original plot or characters , so in my opinion it 's not worth seeing .
i 'm not saying that the movie was bad , it was just a typical anime story and i thought i watched this movie like a thousand times .
so if you are looking for something original see another thing .
