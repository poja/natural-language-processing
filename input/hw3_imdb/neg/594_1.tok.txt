do not waste your money or time .
terrible movie .
bad acting , plot all over the place .
really , really bad acting .
man , this movie is just plain bad .
i shut it off at 7 minutes .
the script is bad , the directing is bad , it seems to me that a high school group got together to do a project for their drama class .
yes , it 's that bad .
the acting is not convincing at all , mind you i saw only 7 minutes of it .
how this movie made it to dvd , is beyond me .
it should have been left in the editing storage room .
i saw the cover and thought it was pretty cool , i sure 's heck wo n't do that next time : _ )
