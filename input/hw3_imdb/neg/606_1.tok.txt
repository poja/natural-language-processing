there is not one character on this sitcom with any redeeming qualities .
they are all self-centered , obnoxious or two dimensional .
my husband watches it , claiming that there is nothing else on , but i would rather watch nothing.the only sitcom that i can think of that was worse was yes , dear .
at least that one did n't get 9 seasons.being overweight does not make a comic genius , and kevin james does not have the talent of john goodman , jackie gleason or john belushi .
leah remini may have talent , but if so , she is wasted on the shrewish wife .
jerry stiller is convincing as an annoying old man .
maybe there is a reason for that.this is a perfect example of why sitcoms are derided .
