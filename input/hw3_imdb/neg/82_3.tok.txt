stmd !
is not a terrible movie , but it is quite forgettable .
the lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest , so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye-strain .
special effects are imaginative , but obvious .
the gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there , of course , along with the archetypical teenagers , but the whole movie just does n't gel .
what was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongue-in-cheek humor.i ca n't really recommend that you use your time watching this movie .
i often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor , but these are sadly lacking in this film .
