great story and great lead actors ( quaid and ryan ) but the movie suffers from bad directing , bad screenplay and bad script.the lead actors do their part but could not save the movie at all.too bad because this could have been a good 80 's style hitchcock suspense/mystery/thriller.ryan looked so young and fresh in this one though.an ok look for big ryan fans ... ..
