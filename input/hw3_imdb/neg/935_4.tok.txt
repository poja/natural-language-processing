i saw this movie considering this as a normal hollywood movie but then came to know that its a movie made for tv channel.on my dvd cover out of 2 critics comments one of the critic stephen farber from moviline reveiwed it as a best movie of the year..all the character were simple and decent performances except the brain 's character which never gets scope which director wanted to keeps mystery till end.. there was suspense till end but when you see the end that lady police officer and main culprit had a lesbian affair seems to be totally stupid idea.god knows what happens to dave the male lead character..the other critic from mr. brown 's movies said that shocking and effective but does n't quite live up to all the hype ... which i saw after watching the movie .for which i was partially aggree ... i should have read this first before taking the movie..
