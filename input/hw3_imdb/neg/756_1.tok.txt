wow , what a racist , profane piece of celluloid garbage , and what an insult to the great genre of westerns.exploitive ?
sex scenes abound , profanity abounds , violence and gore abounds ... ..everything that gives modern movies such a good name , especially among those who prefer classic-era movies .
this is the kind of sleaze that gives the old folks ammunition against today 's films .
somehow i just ca n't picture nude male bathing scenes in randolph scott or gene autrey films .
nor can i picture hearing `` motherf -- -er ! ''
exclaimed here and there .
i sincerely doubt that word was even around over 100 years ago .
yet , the f-word is so prevalent here you 'd think you were watching a story centered in today 's urban areas , not the old west of the 1800s.prejudice ?
well , what if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the nasty , brutal villain ?
do you think someone might complain about a racist movie ?
home come we do n't hear an outcry when the reverse - as demonstrated in this film - is shown in hundreds of theaters across the country ?
mario van peeples wrote , directed and starred in this bomb .
remember that name .
apparently , he is the `` ed wood '' of today 's filmmakers .
even spike lee would n't be this racist .
you ca n't get much worse than this movie .
