talented screenwriter alvin sargent sadly can not get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in los angeles despite mom 's flighty behavior .
apart from several good sequences , i did n't quite buy susan sarandon as a flake ( she 's too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devil-may-care lady ) , and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent .
natalie portman fares much better as her kid , and yet there 's a creepy aloofness to her work ( and some of her scenes , such as the one where she asks a boy to strip , are misguided and uncomfortable to watch ) .
certainly not an incompetent piece , `` anywhere but here '' does have moments that work , but it is n't an embraceable film , nor has it proved to be an important one .
