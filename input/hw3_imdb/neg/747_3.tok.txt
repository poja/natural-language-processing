the bbc and the arts & entertainment network should be ashamed of themselves for foisting this unfortunate production onto the world .
the acting is , with the exception of robert hardy as general tilney , amateurish at best and excruciatingly painful at worst .
the costumes are over-the-top and feature some truly ghoulish excesses -- was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for women 's hats ?
surely every woman in bath did n't have feathers in her headpiece in the early 19th century .
the production values are poor and the pacing of the film makes one feel it was hastily and clumsily edited at the last minute .
altogether an agonizing film that i had to force myself to watch to the end .
it 's a shame , as the producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and location shooting .
compared to emma thompson 's sublime `` sense and sensibility '' or the extraordinary 1995 production of `` pride and prejudice '' or the subtle intensity of 1995 's `` persuasion '' , this production of `northanger abbey ' surely has jane austen turning in her grave .
