i loved the first 15 minutes , and i loved some of the dialogue in the tribunal -- which proved to be the best showcase for the director 's ahead-of-its-time method acting technique -- but this movie ultimately disappoints .
even when viewed purely as a metaphor of the oppressor/oppressed dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the us government and its more `` disobedient '' citizens , it still lacks punch and believability , and ultimately left me looking at my watch hoping the obvious ending would happen already.and for the record : despite rampant rumors to the contrary , this movie has never been banned in the us ( i ca n't comment on the rumors of uk censorship , but i 'm suspicious ) .
hollywood refused to distribute it after its initial film festival showing , and i am more than willing to believe the nixon government had some influence on this decision ; however , the fact that it never appeared on american television is merely a reflection of this medium 's rather careful and advertising-driven fashion of doing business .
as for the present , you can have your very own copy of the dvd delivered to your door via amazon in a few days .
