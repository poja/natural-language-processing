all i can say is , this movie is made for the lifetime channel on tv , which means no solid characters , no particular style , weak acting all kinds of suggested sex but no-breasts and tushs ( because boy , that would just catapult the film into the depths of sleaze would n't it ? )
but the heavily simulated sex , well , that 's ok. when watching these films i have to ask myself , when will these types of tv channels and their advertisers ever grow up ?
i think these companies are actually way behind the times .
they really have no clue what the younger generation is in tune with and if they knew they would demand we change .
the whole point of many american tv channels like these seems mostly to regurgitate the same sanitized , diluded garbage over and over like a generic movie assembly line .
i guess it works for them ... or at least it has .
not sure about the future though .
do n't bore yourself to death like i did .
seek out some real tv movies on hbo , showtime , ifc , starz , etc .
any channel that puts effort into their work and does n't have to ask a priest what they can or can not show .
