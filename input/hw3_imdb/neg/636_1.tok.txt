it is way beyond me how this script was ever sold much less produced and distributed .
the dialogue was so bad it was sickening .
the train and helicopter scenes appeared to have been done on flash cards by high school students .
lou diamond phillips must have hidden under his seat when this -- - this `` movie '' ?
was shown at a private screening afterwhich he most likely left by the back door .
the only emotion it aroused in me was pity for the cast , they had to `` bite the bullet '' to get through this one .
i could n't stand to watch all of it , it was so predictable that it was funny .
who knows maybe it will be picked up by one of the networks as a situation comedy .
