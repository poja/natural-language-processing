starting with a tearjerking poem and images of american missiles , starving children and mutilated palestinians i quickly realised that this was not going to be a objective documentary .
5 youths convicted after the gothenburg riots are interviewed and give a very confused explaination why they had to trash the citycenter and then ( oh my god ) actually have pay for what they have done .
i kept watching and many questions are raised , were the trial properly done and did the cops have the right to do what they did ?
lots of questions asked ... and then dropped .
no interviews with judges or going through documents about the trial.. nothing.in short : nothing new from what every swede has seen on tv a hundred times - just poor propaganda .
