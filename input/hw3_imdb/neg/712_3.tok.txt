released at a time when duvivier was going again from strength to strength .
`` black jack '' which was sandwiched between the overlooked extraordinary `` au royaume des cieux '' and the dazzling stunning `` sous le ciel de paris '' , is a jumble , which duvivier himself hated , which is not surprising.there 's almost nothing to write about this dud.we can notice that : 1.orson welles used to admire duvivier .that may explain why wellesian actors were featured in duvivier 's movies : joseph cotten in `` lydia '' ( 1941 ) , and here a totally wasted agnes moorehead .it 's the first timei have not enjoyed moorehead 's performance !
on the other hand , welles borrowed his desdemona ( suzanne cloutier ) from duvivier 's `` au royaume des cieux '' for his `` othello '' .2.in any duvivier 's movie , there 's one or two worthwhile sequences and this one is no exception : the search in the caves where duvivier 's sense of mystery works wonders ( for a short while ) ; then the chase when dalio gets caught up in the fishnets.duvivier 's touch can be felt in the unhappy end too.as for the rest , as my dear pen pal writer 's reign writes , it 's a black joke .
