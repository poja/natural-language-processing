`` julia kerbridge ( catherine mary stewart ) is working hard to become a doctor .
suddenly , julia finds herself the guardian of her young niece , amanda , after her parents are found murdered .
julia has a new neighbor , the mysterious kevin finney ( rob lowe ) .
her hectic life comes crashing down when it becomes apparent that the young amanda holds the key to a terrible secret .
for she too is now the target of the killers .
julia must discover whether kevin is friend or foe , and unlock the sinister mystery before the murderer strikes again , '' according to the dvd sleeve synopsis.this thriller quietly falls apart at the seams , but it is interesting some of the time .
stalker sean devine 's background telephone scene ( outside the police station ) and mr. lowe 's violin ( restaurant ) are tensely played .
but , early on , it 's difficult not to miss the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers purposely twists his foot in some red paint at the murder scene .
unfortunately , this is not an intricate plot point ; and , there are worse story stumbles afoot .
overall `` dead silent '' is not a bad way to spend some time , if there is nothing better on , or you 're into lowe and his co-stars .
