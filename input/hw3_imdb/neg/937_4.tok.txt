the lifetime channel aired this in october but i only got around to watching it now .
it 's the old eternal triangle again  small-town connecticut boy dave ford ( matt long ) has a quick fling with his best friend 's girlfriend , emily darrow ( emmanuelle chriqui ) , on the eve of his departure for law school in new york , thinks about her for the next five years while he is n't doing contracts and briefs , runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a big exam five years later , and gets involved with her romantically again .
but director and co-writer matthew cole weiss goes way over the top , framing the whole thing in flashback as dave confesses to murdering emily , her husband and another one of her lovers in front of ( here comes the spoiler ) a lesbian cop who 's also a flame of emily 's .
weiss overdoes the `` flanging '' effect by which dave gets to see chunks of his previous life flash before his eyes even before he 's actually dead , cutting those in even while dave and emily are having sex and thereby ruining the soft-core porn shots that give even some otherwise pretty lame lifetime movies at least a bit of audience appeal .
i could n't help but flash back myself to james m. cain and how much better he wrote women like this in his classic thrillers ( all adapted into hit movies ) `` the postman always rings twice , '' `` double indemnity '' and `` mildred pierce . ''
it also does n't help that the film ends with the bad guys ( the bad girls , actually ) triumphant and the decent , if naïve and stupid , hero seemingly on his way to the lethal injection table  or that the actors playing the people dave and emily are cheating on are both better looking than they are .
incidentally , though this film went straight to cable in the u.s. there were some blank spots on the soundtrack indicating where swear words were blipped , so i presume this got a theatrical release somewhere in the world .
