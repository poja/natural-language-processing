a show about an incredibly dumb , man-child and his shrewish hot wife .
99 % of the plots revolves around doug doing something unbelievably stupid and then comes a variable : a ) either he hides it from his wife or b ) tell his wife , she emasculates him and then it 's up to the father-in-law ( arthur : the typecast character from seinfeld ) to aggravate the situation.and the writers dare to say it was influenced by the `` honeymooners '' ( an absolute classic ) and that the plots are drawn from real-life situations , unless you live in a cave , you know that 's not true.anyway , let 's just put it this way .
if kevin james had been thin , the show would have got canceled fromm the pilot .
if you 're 12 , or you 're fond of fat jokes.. be my guest , watch this show ( or any of kevin james movies for that matter ) .i 've noticed some posters compare this travesty to much superior shows like friends , seinfeld and everybody loves raymond -- i 'm still wondering how could anyone do that
