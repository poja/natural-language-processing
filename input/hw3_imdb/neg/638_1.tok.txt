what do you get when you put lou diamond philips , todd bridges , barry corbin with a bad toupee , and an alien all on a train ?
you get a very bad movie called `` alien express '' or `` dead rail '' that would be more entertaining on comedy central 's old series `` mystery science theater 3000 . ''
you name it , this awful movie suffered in areas of acting , plot , storyline , and special effects .
in fact , the exterior passenger train shots looked like the production staff used a common ho scale model in front of a painted background !
the rest of the special effects goes downhill from there.the plot is very predictable and is similar to two 1970 's movies called `` horror express '' and a disaster movie called `` the cassandra crossing . ''
at least `` the cassandra crossing '' had a better cast , an engaging storyline , and real train scenes.if you want a good laugh and a movie to mock at a `` b movie '' party then watch this ; otherwise , `` alien express '' derailed long before departing from the station !
