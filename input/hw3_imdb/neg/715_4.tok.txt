`` people stranded in a country house during a storm discover that the home was the sight of an unsolved murder years before .
during a dinner discussion of the incident , the lights go out and , when they come back on , they discover that one of the guests has been killed .
fearing for their lives , the guests attempt to find out the secrets behind the death before others can occur , '' according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis.there are a couple of clever twists in this murder at the `` old dark house '' story , with the `` play within a play '' being its most interesting feature .
however , the direction is rather ordinary , which serves to highlight a certain cheapness of production .
like most movies of this type , there is ( or , should be ) an ensemble of intriguing characters .
herein , only old-time broadway producer richard carle ( as herman wood ) and his fey secretary johnny arthur ( as homer erskine ) maintain interest .
