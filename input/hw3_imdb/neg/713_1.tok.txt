this is not a movie .
this is a collection of random shots taken in a fascinating part of the world , dubbed over with some random text .
the footage is not that great and the text is not that great either .
the end product is excruciatingly dull.on the dvd , turning the commentary on can provide some entertainment value , as the director makes a rather deranged argument that this is a sci-fi movie .
it 's also fascinating to read about the extraordinary risks and hardship that the crew endured to collect this footage .
too bad it 's rubbish .
but i think `` the making of fata morgana '' would be a fascinating film , sort-of like 'ed wood '' was .
