i am completely into this type of story line but once the movie fired up , i honestly said out loud , `` i just rented a two dollar budget christian pos '' .
the only thing i could find to like about this film was it has a descent story but it was awfully executed .
horrible actors , horrible direction and producing.the director and producer need to go watch the cube before trying to pull off a movie in a single room .
there was absolutely nothing that kept you intrigued to the point that you did n't notice you were in the same room the entire movie .
horrible !
the two main actresses were very easy on the eyes and you could tell that was the director counting on to hold your attention .
but these two and their bios can speak to this , are horrible in front of the camera.do n't rent this .
unless you are blind , because it might go up a few stars if you only listen to it .
