this film probably would have been good , if they did n't use cgi ( computer generated imagery ) for the werewolf scenes.it made the creatures look fake and the werewolves looked cartoonish.cgi is great for certain effects like the dinasours in jurassic park or twister.but when we see a film where the creature must look completely real , cgi is not the way to go.look at an american werewolf in london.no cgi.just makeup and a mechanical creature and what you come up with was more realistic than what was shown in the sequel.this film did offer a few gags that was fun to watch and the humor in this movie seemed to have drawn me in but it 's nothing more than a film that i thought was o.k.and that 's not good enough.in my opinion , an american werewolf in paris does n't hold up to the original .
