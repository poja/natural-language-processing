i like ali g 's show , i believe the guy has comedic instinct , but has n't ( yet ) developed it to a talent.the movie is a little worse than i was expecting .
i do n't find ali-g offensive , just stupid .
jokes for 5-year olds , some good , some terrible.if you want to watch a movie that seems `` offensive '' , but is actually funny , see tom green 's 'freddy got fingered'.2/10
