`` the love letter '' is one of those movies that could have been really clever , but they wasted it .
focusing on a letter wreaking havoc in a small town , the movie has an all-star cast with nothing to do .
tom selleck and alice drummond had so recently co-starred in the super-hilarious `` in & out '' ( also about an upset in a small town ) , in which they were both great , but here they look as though they 're getting drug all over the place .
i ca n't tell what the people behind the camera are trying to do here ( if anything ) , but they sure did n't accomplish anything .
how tragic , that a potential laugh riot got so sorrowfully wasted .
