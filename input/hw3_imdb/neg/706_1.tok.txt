`` atoll k '' aka `` utopia '' is one of hollywood 's saddest swan songs .
filmed in france , `` the land that loves lewis ( jerry ) '' in 1950 and released the following year after a five-year layoff , the boys are in truly terrible shape physically .
however , they are n't in nearly as bad a shape as the script.this movie is one of the un-funniest `` comedies '' ever filmed.it 's painful to see this legendary team , the funniest duo in the history of motion pictures , the twosome that made `` the devil 's brother '' ( 1933 ) , `` the music box , '' ( 1932 ) , '' pack up your troubles '' ( also 1932 ) , `` babes in toyland '' ( 1934 ) , `` bonnie scotland '' ( 1935 ) , `` flying deuces '' ( 1939 ) and so many more gut-wrenching , laugh-til-you-choke classic comedies , in a film such as this.but fighters and ballplayers do it all the time .
they stay in the game one season or one fight too many .
in this case , while is morbidly fascinating to see laurel & hardy at this late stage in their legendary careers , they , too , stuck around for one too many .
