set in 1945 , skenbart follows a failed swedish book editor who decides to take a non-stop train to berlin .
unfortunately for everyone around him , he 's a walking disaster , causing mayhem everywhere he goes .
the train also holds a man and his mistress scheming to murder the man 's wife ( who 's also on the train ) , a soldier on his way home , two gay elderly gentlemen , an angry train conductor , two nuns , a bunch of refugees , and even more people.meant as a mix of noir-ish thriller ( which it does quite well - at least to begin with ) , and comedy , the film fails with both .
it does n't sit right as the film changes tone with every new scene .
and as the train races towards its final destination , the film turns more and more bizarre , ending on a truly surreal note.the good bits are wasted in a myriad of pointless plots and characters .
skenbart is packed with famous swedish actors , no matter how small the part is .
it feels like the filmmakers rang everyone they 've ever worked with and offered them a part in the film .
too bad that the performances are just as bad as the script ( act your lines - do n't read them ! )
.the comedy is more or less slapstick , with the same jokes repeated over and over .
the pace is incredibly slow at times ( quite often , actually ) with on scene in particular dragging on for about ten minutes for no good reason .
the screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue .
the film looks great though , in moody b & w , but it 's wasted on such inept film-making in every other department .
