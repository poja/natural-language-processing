dorothy provine does the opposite here : she keeps growing and growing .
i did n't detect any subtext , though .
`` the incredible shrinking man '' and other movies of its ilk during the period were parables about radiation , nuclear war , and other horrors .
provine 's growth is the result of an inept computer/robot.and who operates this computer but lou costello !
i like some of his movies with bud abbott .
but , though this is a pretty bad movie , he does fine without him .
and gale green is an excellent foil.green plays the pompous town big shot .
he is provine 's father .
he is intent on being elected mayor .
so when his beloved daughter starts having issues , he dumps her .
he does n't exactly dump her but gives up his battle against her longtime admirer costello.this is pretty implausible : costello is the local garbage collector.the special effects are minimal .
and the subplot involving the military is lame in the extreme .
