i 've watched the first 15 minutes and i can tell that there was no consultation with any military type personnel .
judith light 's charactor ( an officer ) has her hair down past her shoulders !
one of the first officers that greets her as she walks in to the medical facility she works at is so overweight that his pant pockets gap !
no - there was no military advising them on this movie .
even an ex-military enlisted could have assisted here .
