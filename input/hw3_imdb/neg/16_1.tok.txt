for years , i 've been a big fan of park 's work and `` old boy '' is one of my all-times favorite.with lots of expectation i rented this movie , only to find the worst movie i 've watched in awhile .
it 's not a proper horror movie ; there 's no suspense in it and even the `` light '' part is so lame , that i did n't know whether to laugh or cry.i introduced my younger brother to chan-wook park and what a disappointment he got from this .
for me , an idol has fallen.if you loved movies like `` old boy '' , the mr & lady `` vengeance '' or even his short films on `` three extremes '' , do n't waste your time , the film 's not worth it .
