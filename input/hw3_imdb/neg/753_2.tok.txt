poor jane austen ought to be glad she 's not around to see this dreadful wreck of an adaptation .
so many great jane austen movies have come out recently that this one deserves to be permanently buried along with two other movies i despise-the man in the gray flannel suit and the 1969 version of david copperfield .
my main beef with the movie is that it completely misses the point of the book .
jane austen was poking fun at the gothic mania in her society , and much of the novel is tongue in cheek .
the movie , however , is serious and comes across terribly melodramatically .
the lighthearted , fun-poking flavor of austen 's writing is completely and conspicuously absent from this ponderous foray iinto horror meets period drama .
the scenes of catherine 's imagination are both gratuitous and uninteresting .
also , henry tilney is dreadfully unappealing .
why , i ask , would anyone fall for him ?
if you are looking for a fun-filled jane austen evening , watch emma instead !
