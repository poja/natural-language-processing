people , get a clue !
i mean , the writers dont have one , so i would expect you to ... this show is such a pale imitation of the '60 show that you can laugh at it !
and the sixties show is the one with the cheap special effects , and is in b & w fer chrissakes !
yet the mood and the writing on the old show is miles ahead of this drivel .
get hip kids !
if 98 degrees or brittany told you to watch it , you would !
you know it !
just bypass them and tell all your friends you were 'in ' with the 'scene ' before it became too cool !
