compared to the recent gore flick hostel , which this movie reminded me a lot of -- i would say that see no evil is slightly better but not by much .
the very complex plot involves a handful of delinquents who are sent to clean up a rundown hotel for a shorter jail sentence .
the kids soon end up being killed off by a lumbering religious psychopath who is cleansing them of their sins ( i guess ) .
the one thing i dreaded most prior to seeing this was the fact that it stared a wwe wrestler , kane .
he ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 one-word lines in the movie .
there are a couple fairly gory moments , mainly involving eye-gouging and a quite memorable scene in which a girl gets a cellphone shoved down her throat -- probably the most effective demise in the movie.i ca n't say that this movie really shows us anything new and is definitely far from great .
ca n't recommend it .
