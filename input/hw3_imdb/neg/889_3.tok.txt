i 'm not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not .
even though marques houston did appear in `` hp3 '' , he played a totally different character ( he was , eight years older ) in this film .
okay ... so reid and martin were n't the most talented and could n't carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the hp franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference ( albeit minor ) to the earlier movies .
i 'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was `` hoodwinked '' -- into thinking that they were seeing a sequel -- not a totally different film with a familiar name .
and i 'm sorry ... kym whitley is not funny , and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris , ketty lester , or dc curry in the earlier films .
although meagen good and mari morrow are a substantial visual diversion ... i have to give this a thumbs down !

just naming the film `` down to the last minute '' would have been ok. furthermore , the hudlin brothers ( who produced the first three movies ) were not involved in the making of this film .
