porn legend gregory dark directs this cheesy horror flick that has glen jacobs ( kane from wwf/wwe/ whatever it calls itself nowadays ) in his cinematic debut .
he plays jacob goodknight , a blind serial killer who 's forte is taking people 's eyes out .
the plot , be it as it may , has a group of troubled youths cleaning up the historical hotel that goodknight resides in and subsequently being offed by him .
hemmingway it 's not .
starts of as fun dopey b-movie , but soon gets too tedious to be enjoyable .
glad i went in with pretty low expectations , but even those were n't met .
how can you have a porn king directing and still suffer from a lack of nudity ?
?
