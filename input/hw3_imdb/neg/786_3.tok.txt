cameron diaz , james marsden , frank langella : that 's an all-star power cast but `` the box '' proves once again that it is not a guarantee for a solid movie .
the premise sounds promising : a couple gets a visit from a mysterious person who offers them a million dollar .
the downside is that someone will die , a person they probably will not know .
so what do you do ?
this gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes .
after that , the story derails completely .
vague an uninspired plot lines about an alien conspiracy involving the nasa , nothing really is explained here .
`` the box '' is a disappointment , could have been so much better .
but since it is based on an ultra short story , that explains the continuity errors .
