without being really the worst science fiction film ever made , or the worst i have seen , 'time under fire ' is still much under average .
the premises and the first 10-15 minutes are not that bad , it starts as a x-files story , combining bermuda triangle mysteries with time travel .
pretty soon elements of other genres ( too many ) mix together , but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a tv series .
soon , 'time under fire ' quickly degenerates into a series of clich√©s , not only mixing altogether too many genres but also being unable to create anything memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow .
acting is bad , and the rhetoric lines in the script do not help at all .
