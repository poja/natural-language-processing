my god , the things that passed for entertainment in this country ... this is *not* the `` tom and jerry '' you may have enjoyed on saturday mornings , featuring a hapless cat and a clever mouse .
this is a much earlier animation series , featuring a pair of mutt-and-jeff clones who get themselves into various scrapes that result in any of the then-typical dancing-skeleton-type gags that made up so much of early animation.this particularly vile outing , apparently originally intended as a vehicle for a pair of actual black stage comedians of the time , has the pair crashing in the ocean while flying to africa , necessitating black-face make-up , exaggerated `` negro '' dialect and `` feets , do n't fail me now '' situations.it only shows that in the 70 years between emancipation and this film , the american view of africans had n't progressed much .
then again , at least one of them apparently had a pilot 's license .
