to remake `` lost horizon '' , as a musical , the need for a rodgers & hammerstein or lerner & lowe type musical composition was needed .
burt bacharach and hal david were the wrong choice .
having said that , my favorite thing about `` lost horizon '' , is its score .
it 's just that the score does n't fit the piece .
the cast , is made-up of mostly non-musical talents ( ullman , finch and hussey , were all dubbed , and still do n't sound all that great ) .frankly , the novella , on which this , and the earlier non-musical film versions were based , is mediocre , at best .
while the possibilities for a truly good , cinematic musical version exist , they are not realized here .
the film succeeds at being a good , rainy-day vehicle , to pass the time .
otherwise , you are better off , buying the cd of its soundtrack .
only recommended as a curiosity piece , due to the film 's awful reputation .
i 've seen much better ; but i 've seen much worse .
