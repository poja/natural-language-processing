saw this as part of the dc reel affirmations film festival .
i hope they got better movies than this , because this film failed to deliver on any of the hopes that audience may have entertained , from the fantasy of seeing james franco without his shirt , down to more simple wishes , such as decent acting , coherent direction , character development , or actual production values .
plagued by film school effects such as freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress , and obvious influences ranging from my own private idaho to terminator 2 , this film failed on almost every level to engage the audience .
after the first twenty minutes of valiantly trying to take it seriously , the audience collectively threw up it 's hands and just started to enjoy the inherent crappiness of the film .
i could be upset that i paid nine bucks to see it , and it was two hours i 'll never get back , but on the other hand , it was an entertaining two hours i 'll never get back .
this would have been a classic mystery science 3000 episode .
