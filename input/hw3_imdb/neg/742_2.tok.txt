i 'm afraid i did not like this adaptation .
when i started watching it i had a strange feeling of watching some 70s tv series , due to the filter and the musical score .
i did not like the end scene .
mr tilney appears dressed only in his waistcoat .
jane austen would never have a gentleman ride out without a frock coat .
looks like the producers made a modern misinterpretation of a romantic girl 's dream .
i appreciate the more modern ja adaptations much more , that show an eye for these details , that makes the bbc series so worthwhile .
sorry , looking forward to the 2007 adaptation .
i hope that will be better and will show the benefits of 20 years of jane austen adaptations .
