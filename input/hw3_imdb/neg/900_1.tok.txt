i do n't know what the makers of this film were trying to either accomplish or say , but they badly failed at whatever it was .
unless of course the object was to totally confuse the viewer .
i watched this movie simply because drew barrymore was in it , and it turned out that she had a smaller than small cameo in it .
the whole idea of having this kid go on some wild car trip to win a big money prize from a gas station game and meet up with all sorts of wackos is utterly ridiculous .
