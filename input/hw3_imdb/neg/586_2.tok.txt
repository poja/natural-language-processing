very strange screenplay by cameron crowe ( following on the heels of his `` fast times at ridgemont high '' ) has little inspiration and flails away at dumb gags .
at least `` fast times '' had a fair share of satire and sensitivity behind its slapstick ( courtesy of a good director , amy heckerling , and crowe 's undeniable penchant for capturing letter-perfect teen-speak ) ; here , chris penn ( sean 's brother , natch ) is the goof-off who makes life hell for straight arrow eric stoltz , and the filmmakers seem to think he 's hilarious .
jenny wright has some good moments as a mall-worker , but illan mitchell-smith is lost in a head-scratching subplot about a teen who seems to be infatuated with a shell-shocked ex-soldier .
queasy , confused nonsense given a shiny sheen and a soundtrack full of pop-rock tunes , but characters one would hope to avoid .
supporting players lea thompson , rick moranis , lee ving , and sherilyn fenn are wasted in stupid roles .
