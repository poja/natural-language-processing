i 've got as much testosterone as the next bloke , and raquel welch at her finest is certainly worth a look ; but the fact is that a cardboard cut-out could act better , and an hour and half of ms. w showing off her considerable assets does not a movie make.considering the cast , it 's surprising that it 's as bad as it is .
i 've never been a big fan of wagner , and his tough guy harry is about as convincing as a 9-dollar bill .
godfrey cambridge and vittorio de sica , both of whom i usually enjoy , seem to be sleeping through their lines ; and as for edward g ... well , i can only assume he was there for the paycheck.this film is a mess : from non-existent plot , through stop-start action and unfunny script to puerile slapstick and annoying 60 's 'caper ' music .
if it were n't for miss welch , i 'd have given it a 0.that said , she is a treat to the eyes - even better than her delicious cameo in 'bedazzled ' - and for that reason alone i gave it a 3 .
