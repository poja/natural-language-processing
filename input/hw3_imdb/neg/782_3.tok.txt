the box is a film with great potential , but the makers totally misused that potential .
the film seemed to take for ever , because of the boring family dinners and scenes about school and job-dialogs between the action .
those scenes could and must be deleted in my opinion to keep up the tensity and thrill .
the philosophy of human free will has potential and seems to referring to the philosophy of thomas hobbes ( 1588-1679 ) , but we find ourselves regretfully struck with magic and nosebleeds , were even harry potter would flunked his class with !
probably the best part was that moment when norma lewis ( cameron diaz ) has been shot to death , by her loving and caring husband as an act of human free will .
i wonder how hobbes would react if he could ...
