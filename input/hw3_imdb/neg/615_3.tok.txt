this is a film that really makes me cringe .
in 1951 , mgm and looney toons were making some of their very best cartoons -- with amazing animation , exceptional backgrounds and great stories .
then , in the late 40s , a new style of animation began to appear ( such as the `` crusader rabbit '' series on tv ) -- animation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money .
unfortunately , columbia picture 's cynical ploy worked !
!
instead of the public hating the toons ( as they should have ) , many accepted them and the oscar people ( ampas ) actually gave this film the award for best animated short -- giving legitimacy for an inferior product .
unfortunately , in the dollars and sense world of hollywood , this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios -- resulting in rather crappy cartoons .
later , it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds , the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch .
the cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone .
and for this tragedy , i blame , in part , gerald mcboing-boing -- one of the granddaddies of cheap cartoons .
the story is n't that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying `` boing-boing '' incessantly is a pain .
