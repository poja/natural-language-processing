this is one of four 1970s movies by tv writer lane slate about sensationalistic murders in small towns .
they feature likable tv personalities as police chiefs and quirky characters as town regulars , including light-touch love interests .
the others are : they only kill their masters ( james garner , 1972 ) ; and the girl in the empty grave and deadly game ( both andy griffith , 1977 ) .alda 's is set near vermont ( `` mount angel '' next to `` horse creek '' ) ; the others in california , garner 's at seaside ( `` eden landing '' ) and griffith 's in the mountains ( `` jasper lake '' ) .
all try to capture the feel of a small town , to move at a relaxed pace among comfortable characters , and to tell a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turn to it .
on that level , they are somewhat entertaining ( that they were often re-run itself suggests they have some appeal ) .
but they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue , slack pacing , bland settings , flat or exaggerated characters , and off-putting , forced attempts ( often juvenile or crude ) at color or humor.alda 's and garner 's are the most serious about story , characters , pacing , and tone .
they have the best supporting casts , though alda 's is put to better use ; the griffith casts pale in comparison .
alda 's has the best director .
`` shocking '' has some surprise and drama .
the killer 's method is inventive .
the tone is more even , and the dialogue more natural , than in griffith 's .
alda 's film does not suffer like the others from smug big-city transplants to the town or from hokey , exaggerated local characters , both of which come across as figments of a hollywood scriptwriter , not as genuine ( the worst offender is the griffith movies ' pipsqueak , mumbling moron `` whit , '' who , we are told , tried to hook a jeep up to and make off with a trailer serving as a temporary bank branch , dragged away the dock for the police boat , stole tomatoes from a farmer 's truck only to get nothing for them , and filled out $ 11 on the withdrawal slip of `` spiro t. babylis '' only to be discovered by the teller ) .
mercifully absent is the clunky , heavy-handed repetitive-style dialogue from the griffith movies ( `` you going to lunch ? ''
`` i 'm going to take out the boat . ''
`` you going to take the boat to lunch ? ''
`` i 'm not going to lunch . ''
`` you 're not going to take the boat to lunch ?
`` ; `` there are n't any fish in this lake .
why are you fishing here ? ''
`` it 's illegal in horse mountain . ''
`` it 's posted here too , you 're breaking the law . ''
`` some law .
there are n't any fish in this lake . ''
`` then why are you fishing here ? ''
`` i told you , it 's illegal in horse mountain .
`` ; `` please call me lloyd .
my name is lloyd . ''
`` okay , lloyd ... '' `` call me lloyd .
that 's my name .
my name is lloyd .
`` ) but alda is too low-key and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a small-time police chief , certainly not a red-hot lawman in demand by a rival town .
slate has the character admit as much , when he comes late to the scene of a by then obvious clue , as a result of an accidental name recognition .
rather than detect or investigate , barnes strikes out blindly in emotional denial .
his secretary lasser feeds him a key clue ( `` why did n't i think of that , '' he says ! )
.
an embarrassing funeral scene , plus a plot contrivance , leads to another gift clue.worse , barnes is more interested in deriding the military-style helmets of the county police sent to help him ( deadly game also suggests slate has something against the military ) than leading them or his own men effectively .
he allows a late murder by incompetently guarding a known target .
barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer fleeing one crime scene , without drawing his gun or trying to take control .
again , he is ineffective , and nearly killed , in the climactic scene , which results from multiple errors on his part that are only partially corrected , by accident .
the erratic northeastern accent that alda affects does not help believability.there are plot holes .
why would the killer strike after all these years ?
and committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible .
but they are nothing compared to later ones -- a couple together , a shopkeeper in his store during business hours , a fully clothed deputy seated in his office and , unbelievably , his dog !
alda 's movie also suffers from some offensive elements that slate injects into all the movies .
barnes first appears in a motel clerk 's bed .
he then treats her rudely at every turn and insults and tries to avoid her kids .
this , and talk about the female doctor , smack of a crude , mean-spirited pattern ( garner 's film has been described as `` sleazy , '' including a scene where he and a deputy laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy in the car with her .
griffith 's feature an ersatz ropers routine , in which the woman embarrassingly tries to coax the man into `` the supply closet '' ; a gratuitous locker-room-type exchange with a deputy in discussing a young woman 's car accident death ( `` did you take her out ? ''
`` i took her in once .
`` ) ; a reference to bank teller `` bernice '' as `` swollen-up in places '' and to `` sticking a pin in '' her and to `` hating '' and firing secretary `` maude '' because she was `` too hairy '' ; a description of the female doctor 's practice as `` two stirrup tables and a flashlight '' ; a humiliating scene in which fran ryan propositions griffith , offering `` some home grown '' ; and an insulting subplot in which a woman , pursued by a deputy played as a drippy buffoon , seems to `` sleep around '' ) .finally , alda 's film has a grim , bleached-out , colorless , lifeless look and feel .
only louise lasser adds spark .
at least the other films had some spirit , scenery , and pleasant music ; griffith 's got out onto the mountainside , onto the lake , and even out into the big city .
you feel more like re-watching masters or empty grave than shocking .
