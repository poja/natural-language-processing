first of all , blythe danner does n't look anywhere near old enough to play capshaw 's daughter ( and in fact she is n't -- only ten years apart ) .i understand this is supposed to be one of those magical , moonstruck type supernatural romances but this is beyond the pale .
very , very weak in terms of acting , script and direction .
the only one who really shines here is ellen degeneres , who makes this film watchable -- if not really believable herself as she 's cast as a bit of a heterosexual sex hound .
but endearing nonetheless .
actually , degeneres and the skin shots of the young guy capshaw dallies with together make this watchable .
but no one can really tell if capshaw is really in love with the young guy or not ; neither the script nor her acting pull it together for us and we 're left to wonder how she really feels .
