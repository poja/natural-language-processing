hillary swank is an unattractive piece of work in this unattractive piece of work of a film .
pat morita , desperate for work , any kind of work , agreed to reprise his role as the `` karate teacher '' and bring his brand of karate to the silver screen once again , except this time , hillary `` skank '' swank is the student.i can just see the hollywood writers getting excited about the idea of having a `` tormented , spoiled brat '' female take the role from ralph .
the film does not work on any level and it 's boring on every level .
there 's nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for anyone to hold on to .
the film was made without any thought of making money because it 's just so bad.i would gladly spit on all the actors in this film for having been involved with it and have the writers black-listed for their miserable and insulting efforts .
