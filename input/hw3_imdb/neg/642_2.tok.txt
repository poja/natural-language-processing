alien express is one of the worst movies i 've bothered to experience.the plot is predictable .
the aliens look like rubber sock puppets .
the effects would have been mediocre in the 70 's , but are just atrocious by today 's standards .
could n't they take a shot of a real train instead of using an obvious model ?
the acting is n't great but , really , the dialogue is the worst part .
it gouges its way into your mind .
`` do n't you die on me .
not now . ''
if you ever manage to suspend disbelief long enough to be absorbed into the movie , you 'll rapidly be jolted painfully back to reality by the aliens , the model train , or the clich√©d dialogue.the only reason i did n't give this movie a `` 1 '' is that it does n't deserve to be rated so badly that some poor suckers might watch it for the pleasure inherent in a truly bad film .
