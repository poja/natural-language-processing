an american werewolf in london had some funny parts , but this one is n't so good .
the computer werewolves are just awful : the perspective is all off , it 's like seeing them through a distorting mirror .
the writers step on the throat of many of their gags .
american boy says to parisian girl , `` is there a cafe ' around here ? ''
instead of just leaving it at that , they have to have the girl sigh and respond , `` this is paris . ''
