i will confess that once i started watching this movie , it had a hold on me that forced me to watch it through to its conclusion .
quite possibly this was some latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero get it on with his victim , or maybe fascination that they got funding to make , distribute , and show this film that kept me searching it for merit , or possibly some bizarre wish-fulfillment fantasy that there might be a point at the end of all the pain .
but no such luck.so you are warned to not start watching it in the first place , lest the same thing happen to you .
there 's nothing here worth wasting your hour and a half on.the first-person mockumentary and the schtick about fabian 's `` quest '' to impregnate women of the falklands comes out even more like a sophomoric ( maybe freshman - high school freshman , that is ) film student project than you might imagine .
the effect ends up being both sneering at the local inhabitants ( who , other than the two professional leads , are in fact real people ) as well as engaging in rather disgusting sexual politics ( no matter whether you take it all literally or symbolically , it 's pointless and sexist ) .the reason i ended up watching it all the way is the same reason that once one starts to pick at a scab , there 's an irresistable fascination of continuing to do so until it 's completely off , even when you know it 's bad for you .
you just want to see what happens.in the end , this is rather dishonest filmmaking , because it seems ultimately to have no moral center , no elucidation of the local political situation , nor any place in the type of political-sexual-personal film universe a la goddard .
in short it 's got nothing to say and spends a long time pretending it does .
smug would be the one-word tagline.i 'd suggest the filmmakers rent 'waiting for guffman ' a few times , or hell , even 'blair witch project ' if they want to pursue the schtick with a little more style and a little more genuine emotion .
or at least entertainment value .
