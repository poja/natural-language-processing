this was an interesting adaption of william shakespeare 's last known solo play but in my humble opinion , a terrible one .
jarman tries to change the personalities of the characters for a start .
he makes miranda seem insane after being stuck on the island for so long , prospero is no different - a mix of madness and self-pity on his part .
i could not imagine shakespeare thinking his characters to be anything like the way jarman portraits them.caliban 's appearance is maybe the only thing he got right , but then again , i was under the impression that caliban was a tormented , deformed monster but turns out to be an insane rambling , northerner who is constantly cackling , not as i would have imagined him .
ferdinand makes a brief appearance , naked most the time and quiet.in fact , to the point i stopped watching this awful adaption , their had been so many lines cut from the play .
if anything , i think jarman was trying to re-write shakespeare and include his own scenes most the time .
so much text is cut out in the first part it makes it not a shakespeare play , but a load of 70 's melodramatic , preposterous rubbish.an attempt to interpret this play more realistically in the end , but this play was never a realistic one and it was made nothing like the text displays it to be .
