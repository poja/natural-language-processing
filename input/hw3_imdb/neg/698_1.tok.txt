i really enjoy this genre but the cell was one of the worst movies i 've ever been unfortunate enough to watch .
while about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater during the viewing ( or left entirely ) i was dumb enough to stick it out .
the main problems with this story ( there were too many to list all ) is that with this type of film you have to do two things ... one , provide fear of the killer ( being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that 's gone ) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake ( the girl in the tank ) enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time or not .
not only did i lose track of the girl , i was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when i did remember she was part of the story i really did n't care what happened to her .
while the visuals were interesting in an lsd flashback sort of way , they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals ca n't make up for lack of a good story ( see phantom menace for another example ) finally , does anyone know or care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky ?
ridiculous .
