this looks so good on paper - matt damon , lawrence fishbourne , jean reno , nice right ?
and a heist with $ 42 million - sounds like a kick-ass crime movie.big disappointment - i reckon the stars got all the money because the production values on this are lousy.but more than that it the pseudo reservoir dogs atmosphere when the easy crime goes wrong .
it 's very much made for tv stuff.all in all hugely disappointing - it score points for being what it is - but loses them massively for being , bluntly , not very interesting at all ...
