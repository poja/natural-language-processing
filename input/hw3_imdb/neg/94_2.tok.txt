the most positive points in this film were the credits ( text style ) and some moments in ice-t 's acting .
the story-line ; two rival gangs having to fight it out , with the sub-plots of betrayal , power and change are well worn plots but in this case painful ( very ) to wade through .
the decrepit scenery , which added slight believability in places , and questionable lighting , constantly distracted from any interest/identification with the characters ( the shine off of the actress 's forehead/nose was blinding , not to mention other scenes with the same problem . )
not even half way into the film i wanted to know more about how and why it came about as opposed to what was going on on screen .
a disappointment if you have seen ice-t in other roles .
kudos to other actors/actresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weak direction ; corrupt 's side kick and the other restaurant worker .
