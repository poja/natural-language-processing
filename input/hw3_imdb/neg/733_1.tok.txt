i watched `` fuckland '' a long time ago .
i lied if i 'd tell that i remember it in detail ; what i remember most vividly is the irritation it provoked me and the feeling of a total waste of precious money and time , not only my time and money invested in watching the movie but also the director's.supposedly , `` fuckland '' is a critic of argentinians , presenting us ( i 'm an argentinian too ) as little people who take credit for and even boast about petty , ridiculous victories , and think we 're the best thing that god ( who is also an argentinian ) created .
i 'm not going to argue that .
it 's probably a true statement about a quite big part of the population ( the part i despise , by the way ) .
and even if this were n't true , that 's not my point .
the worst sin `` fuckland '' committed was to express such a statement about its own director.the continuous impression i received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us for sneaking a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good ( even a mediocre ) movie .
many of the takes made with a hidden camera are pointless .
the director chooses to show off with a silly edition of old war takes and his own ones .
and there 's no plot at all.moreover , this movie proudly presents a dogme certificate before the opening titles , only to disrespect its principles afterwards ( for example , by including the director in the credits - another sign of his pride ? )
.i found the movie offensive , not as an argentinian , but as a watcher .
i felt underestimated .
`` fuckland '' is simply one of the worst movies i 've ever seen .
