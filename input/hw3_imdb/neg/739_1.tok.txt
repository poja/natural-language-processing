this is a terrible movie , that is barely recognizable from the book , although they have sort of similar plots .
the time it takes to watch this movie ( which is only 1.5 hours ) would be much better spent doing anything else , including watching grass grow .
the addition of poorly done fantasy scenes make catherine seem insufferably silly .
the actress who plays catherine also comes across ditzy as all goodness and looks constantly surprised , even when she 's supposed to be looking lovingly into her tilney 's eyes .
honestly !
!
the movie ends with a catherine fantasy-like scene where one ca n't help but wonder if it 's happened or if she 's merely delusional , and not in the good way that makes you think but in a perfectly horrible way that basically sums up the terrible movie .
the only good thing about the movie is the title , which was written by ms. austen herself .
i generally love the bbc 's productions but this one is horrid .
