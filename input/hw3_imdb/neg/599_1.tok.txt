i would have given this less than a 1 rating if it were possible .
the entire film should have been left on the cutting-room floor .
what a pathetic waste of time , money and effort !
let 's see ... assemble the prettiest cast you can find ( which of course is in direct proportion to the amount of talent they lack ) ... throw together the thinnest plot you can dig up ... and viola !
an abominable piece of trash that the director and/or producer should be ashamed to put their name on .
how much worse can the horror genre get ?
and do n't use `` low budget '' as an excuse ... i have seen many great low-budget films ... .in fact some of the best horror classics of all time were low-budget .
if you do n't have the talent and ingenuity to make a good horror film , then for god 's sake do n't make one at all !
