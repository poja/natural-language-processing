with all the hype surrounding the stars of the movie , this movie left me wanting .
i expected a much better movie considering the inclusion of the talents of murphy , de niro and russo but found that the movie fell flat on it 's face .
comedy sequences were overdone and the superior performances of the stars especially de niro and russo could n't save this one !
