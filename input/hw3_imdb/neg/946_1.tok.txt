synopsis : kid is not accepted into any colleges .
he creates a `` college '' where he and his friends can party by using their parent 's tuition money .
wow .
a paean to ignorance .
if you believe that we 're all ok , man , then this movie is for you .
furthermore , you must understand that:1. kids have it all inside them -- they just need to let it out.2 .
teaching really stifles the innate creativity that everyone is born with .
3. someone else should pay for you to follow your passion .
4 .
300 teenagers can live together in harmony , as long as you take away those restrictive rules .
5. extemporaneous speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation .
6. if the board of education allows you to open a `` charter school '' with `` nontraditional teaching techniques , '' it 's because they have your best interests at heart .
( not that they are willing to let go of low-functioning students who will end up working fast food anyways . )
this movie is one in the college comedy genre , i.e .
animal house .
it follows the pattern pretty closely .
what 's new here though , is a complete attack on higher education , not a parody of the bad elements .
it 's missing the sympathetic insider , a professor who embodies the worthwhile part of university life .
this lack of balance will doom this film to the back rows of blockbuster .
it is so one sided , that i wondered if it was an ironic self-referential take on the whole genre -- for about one minute .
the movie has no deep meaning , no layers , no introspection .
it 's as if they let some kids who never went to class do what comes naturally .
and what is natural is what the name of the school is : s*** .
( never thought i 'd say this : go see something with will farrell instead .
his comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated . )
