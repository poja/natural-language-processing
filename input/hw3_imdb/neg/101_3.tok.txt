i gave this a 3 out of a possible 10 stars.unless you like wasting your time watching an anorexic actress , in this film it 's carly pope , behaving like a ditz , do n't bother.carly pope plays sara novak , a young college student , who becomes intrigued with a game of riddles , that leads her down into subway tunnels underneath the city - a dangerous thing for even a well-armed man to go in alone.there are various intrigues in the film -- a weirdo classmate who is apparently stalking sara , a cynical shopkeeper who runs some kind of offbeat hole-in-the-wall establishment that appears to be located in the back alley of a ghetto , a nerdish dim-wit that hangs around the cynic 's shop , and a woman named emily gray , who is back in prison.sara 's father is a lawyer who is handling emily gray 's case .
a few years back , emily gray attempted to drown a 12 year old boy .
emily was put in a mental hospital for 5 years , and for some cockeyed reason they let her out again , even though it is obvious she is still dangerously deranged.the only explanation emily has ever given for her crime is : i never sinned.it 's all part of the design.well , my friend , do n't expect to ever get any better explanation than that , because you wo n't .
