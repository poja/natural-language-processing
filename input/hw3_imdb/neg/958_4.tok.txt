this review contains a partial spoiler.shallow from the outset , 'd.o.a . '
at least starts as if it might be a slick , entertaining piece of nonsense like fincher 's 'the game ' .
it 's central character ( dennis quaid ) suffers from a nightmarish sequence of events that appear to be setting up a twisted and cunning thriller .
but the plot rattles along at too great a pace , leading to a dramatic twist not half way through , when the character learns that he has been poisoned and has only 1-2 days to live .
and this , simply , is too big a twist to add casually to a story .
once this has happened , the film 's only chance of success is if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its principal , indeed , its only subject matter : but 'd.o.a . '
continues as if this was just a normal revelation like any other you might usually encounter in a thriller .
the problem is two-fold : firstly , quaid 's actions do n't convince as what someone is his situation would be likely to do ; and secondly , even if they did convince , it 's hard to care about what happens next when the most significant point of plot has already been prematurely resolved .
the rest of the film is pretty standard fare for a film of this sort , but made more tedious than usual by the character 's slightly-treated predicament , which logically dwarfs the events the film is interested in .
dennis quaid , in the lead role , does n't convince either as a burnt out professor or as a man who is destined to die : meg ryan is , as often , ditzy and annoying .
another negative feature is the ugly 80s soundtrack .
watch 'the game ' instead , which from similar roots remains tight and character-driven , whereas 'd.o.a . '
drifts into developments that only undermine its own premise .
as the premise is itself quite intriguing , it 's a shame to see it drowned in a surplus of over-cooked plot .
