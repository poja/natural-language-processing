we brought this film as a joke for a friend , and could of been our worst joke to play .
the film is barely watchable , and the acting is dire .
the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance .
the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on .
it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable.just terrible
