i could n't .
i was bored , not just because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was simply a b-movie whose plot was all about the cannibalism , but the fact i was watching a subtitle foreign film , which does n't bother me at all , but was still dubbed.the `` special effects '' were awful .
as the back of the plane splits off , you can see the model is hollow as it `` breaks away '' in the phony snow .
most of the movie takes place on a sound stage that clearly is not real and almost looks like a play , as the `` sounds '' of snow blowing all over are heard but not actually scene .
`` but how what will they eat ?
they have no food '' one military person ( it 's never clear what this guy does or why he 's in charge ) says , which i 'm sure no one ever said in reality or even thought about food , since they were concerned if the people were alive , not how they 'd eat .
it was simply a stupid line written to point out that , yes , they will have to eat the dead bodies to survive.when they finally decide to eat the bodies , one man finds one shirtless body , who despite being in the snow for however long , is not remotely frozen , in fact , his flesh is very flexible and fresh .
he cuts the fresh meat off his back , that again , is not frozen or even cold it appears , and this scene goes on for five minutes .
that 's where i had to stop .
the remake `` alive '' was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that i 'm sure the real survivors praised whereas i ca n't imagine any of them had anything nice to say about this version .
it was simply about eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary .
avoid .
