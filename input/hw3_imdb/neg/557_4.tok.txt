`` the next karate kid '' is a thoroughly predictable movie , just like its predecessors .
its predictability often results in a feeling of impatience on the viewer 's part , who often wishes the story could move a little faster .
despite its lulls and its extreme familiarity , however , this fourth entry in the series is painless , almost exclusively because of the presence of morita .
he does n't seem tired of his role , and he does inject some life and humor into the film , becoming the best reason for you to see it .
not awful , but nothing much , either .
