i a huge fan of when it comes to doctor who series and still am , but i was very disappointed when i began to watch this new series.children under the age of 15 , or even better under the age of 10 will probably will enjoy it the best , and possibly new fans who have n't seen any of the original series , but as far as fans of the original series , will find this series missing much of the charm the made the original series so great , it took david tennant to get me to appreciate how much better christoper eccellestion was as a doctor in the 1st season.i would only recommend this series for people who have n't seen much of the original series , people who are under 15 , and extremely die hard who fans , everyone else will just get a laugh and mumble curse words about russel t. davies screwed up one of our favorite tv shows .
