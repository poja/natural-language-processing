how i deserved to watch this crap ?
?
?
worst ever .
the acting was awful , when i read that this was a comedy i expected at least to smile , once - or twice , but ... .
if you are wiling to loose hour and a half of your lives , this is the right movie .
i recommend just look in a wall or something , anything else but watch this `` film '' .
yoy can even watch a documentary ( if you are a guy ) about pregnant women , i guarantee it will be more entertaining : ) the actor in this one ( i forgot his name ) is not that bad , and i am surprised how hi accepted the role .
anyway `` i want someone to eat cheese with '' is the right film if you want to punish someone .
