tamara anderson and her family are moving once again , as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape .
fifteen years old , she is in her rebellious stage .
already angry at her father for their frequent relocations , her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis .
her mother 's absence causes tamara to lash out at her father and seek comfort in religion , the boy next door , rusty , as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented house.the story is modest to a fault .
it 's oddly paced , and even during its emotional scenes there is n't any tension .
the actors portraying the parents are fine .
alberta watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother , and maria ricossa is particularly effective as the guilt-ridden mother of the dead teenager .
but katie boland , as tamara , is too amateurish to carry the movie .
the dialog is very natural and boland ca n't quite pull it off .
she has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there were too many times when she came off awkward .
one can see her thinking 'ok this is what my line is and this is the face i 'm supposed to make ' rather than actually reacting to the other actors .
she 's not the only one , kevin zegers as rusty and megan park as his sister brenda also suffer from stilted delivery but at least they 're in fewer scenes.if done right , the screenplay could have made her an affecting movie .
and it has it moments but much of it is bogged down with an amateurish lead performance and flat directing .
