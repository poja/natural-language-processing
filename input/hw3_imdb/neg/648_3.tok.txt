`` i presume you are here for damage to your mental circuitry . ''
- valmike nelson made me watch this ... he mentioned it in his book , `` movie megacheese . ''
i asked myself , `` why would mike nelson steer me wrong ? ''
i now know why the bots never trusted mike nelson.the music is by john williams , which is probably part of his payment to the devil .
in fact , i 'm sure anyone who worked on this movie is probably in league with ol ' slewfoot , or is now cursed , from the executive director down to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio .
do n't watch ... for the love of god ... do n't watch !
!
!
not even making a copy and showing someone else will un-curse you ... i 'm doomed now , i understand this .
i accept this .
but save yourself ...
