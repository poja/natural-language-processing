is this a game fmv or a movie ?
in all honesty , i watched this one out of `` choice-less-ness '' .
it is a very big waste of time and money.it seems hk movies are heading in the opposite direction of the rest of the world.try to put more effort and money into a production and make us want to watch , rather than something you want us to watch.the graphics are so horrible than they looked like something out of the early to mid-90s low resolution games ( in comparison to today 's ) .the way they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the 90s ' wing commander game , namely the third installment of the series .
stop regressing and make us asian look so bad at this compared to the big guns in hollywood.sure !
they have big budgets and better actors .
but we have some of the oldest histories , the myths and the legends , the best technophiles and possibly the largest computer graphic talent base in the world !
so what went so very very wrong ?
did you start using the same old companies that have been working with you for so many films ?
!
please stop wasting our time and money .
this is the reason why hk movies are heading downhill so rapidly .
did n't you claim to be the hollywood of the orient ?
guess not .
