i am the kind of person who can enjoy a good b movie if it has some kind of redeeming value to it , but dead space has nothing to redeem it !
this is the kind of film that will make you frustrated , restless and sick to your stomach .
bad acting .
lame story .
terrible effects .
horrible , excruciating dialogue .
dead space has it all !
