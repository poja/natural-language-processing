humm , an italian movie starred by david hasselhoff and linda blair , i wasn´t expecting very much , to be honest and in fact , i took even less than i was expecting .
it doesn´t mean this movie is the worst i have seen because i have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this .
apart from that you are going to love some special effects , they are really cheesy and bad .
now i only want to watch `` troll 3 '' by this same director , sure it is not going to be worse than that .
