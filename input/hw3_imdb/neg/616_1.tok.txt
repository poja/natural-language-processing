with several name actors ( lance henrikson , david warner , joe don baker ) , why was jeffery combs given the lead ?
henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead , as would warner , baker or even others in the movie such as charles napier .
combs was miscast in this , and did a poor job of it .
everything he did seemed fake or contrived.the script is poor .
meaning that if lance henrikson ( or another ) had the lead role , he might have saved the film ( removed it from my `` waste of time '' category ) , but it still would have been a bad movie .
the screen play was completely lacking .
the director should have recognized this and helped the movie along .
