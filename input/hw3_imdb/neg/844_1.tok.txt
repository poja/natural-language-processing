an awful travesty of the greek resistance .
senorita cruz badly miscast as a cephalonian greek girl ( there are plenty of attractive good english Â–speaking greek actresses so why pick a spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an english actor as her father , supposedly a greek doctor !
?
many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from greek theatre and tv series .
the only foreign actor , to my knowledge , who has successfully portrayed a greek was anthony quinn ( as the macedonian lignite miner zorba in zorba the greek , as the plutocratic shipowner in the greek tycoon , and as a greek colonel in the guns of navarone.there is some historical truth reflected in the film .
people who remember the italian occupation of the ionian islands agree that the italians were not harsh , unlike the germans who succeeded them .
also mussolini 's forces , as hinted in the movie , had been defeated by the greek army in the albanian campaign .
after the germans intervened in the balkans they allowed the italian military to occupy certain parts of greece , so the refusal of the local government to surrender to italian forces , rather than to the germans .
as portrayed in the film is quite plausible , although i am not certain this actually happened .
