when the movie begins , it 's obvious just how old and sick the boys are .
although oliver hardy is enormous , it is stanley that looks like death warmed over .
apparently , he was deathly ill during production and had obviously lost a lot of weight .
although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half , here he looks like a dying man .
additionally , as i watched the film i was shocked how many pratfalls stan took -- i half expected his to drop dead from the exertion .
i really ca n't understand why they came out of retirement considering their health -- especially when the story and production values are as poor as they are with this film .
stanley inherits an island and a boat .
he and ollie are ready to leave when antoine , a stateless man , is literally dropped into their boat and they begin their voyage to find the island .
along the way , they discover that giovanni has stowed away , but despite this the four men become friends and land on a different island .
it seems like paradise and they are all very happy .
a bit later , a pretty young lady joins them and everything looks grand.unfortunately , uranium is discovered on the island and the place becomes flooded with riffraff .
eventually , the mob decides to hang the four men and take over -- at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are spared.i will give the film some credit for being original and for being interesting .
however , one thing it is not is funny -- and that is unforgivable for a laurel and hardy flick .
while not a bad film , it certainly is n't a good one .
a sad end to their brilliant careers.all the actors , except for the duo , are dubbed into english , as the movie was made in france .
while it may not be the very worst film they made ( this would be the big noise ) , it sure is close !
!
watching this film is painful and like watching people clean up after a severe accident .
