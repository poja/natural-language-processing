rob lowe must have eaten up the entire budget , but i ca n't fault him for running with the money .
even he would have to agree , there was nothing good about this movie .
filming , editing , direction , dialogue , sets , makeup , writing , casting ( especially the young girl and imposter child psychiatrist ) , and the story all were just the worst .
i have never seen such a horrible movie .
pass this one up for any other rental selection , or find yourself shouting out vile comments at the tv .
dead silent should be silenced for all time .
