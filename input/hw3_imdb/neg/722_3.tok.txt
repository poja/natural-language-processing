derek jarman has shown us time and time again that dialog is not his strong suit .
he is a painter , and paint he does .
his films are almost always visually splendid , but about as exciting to watch as paint that is already dry .
watch his movies in fast forward , the really fast setting that you can only get on dvd .
in the tempest , jarman does very little with the script or the characters , using them as simply a lattice to hang a very long and well-constructed cinematographic frame .
he even goes so far as to contradict shakespeare 's original script to achieve these excrucriatingly slow and lifeless scenes .
there is none of the romance , magic , trickery , or urgency the script calls for , little spontaneity , and the character of caliban in particular is reduced to a quivering and insane idiot of sorts , similar to gaveston in jarman 's edward ii .
it is too bad that this is just about the only film version of the tempest available .
