shaky hand held cameras ( this piece was shot for television mind you , not film ) not only keep you utterly conscious of how horrible the cinematography is in this film , but make you absolutely unable to become immersed in the story .
poor miss austen must be rolling in her grave .
all i can say is , if you enjoyed the novel , stop there , until the bbc creates one of their smart & sensible period masterpieces ( like pride & prejudice with colin firth , which , speaking for what i imagine in my opinion , austen would have revered ) .
the bbc would never dare overdub cheesy saxophone solos and indigo girl hollers over a shot of an historic castle and a loving embrace .
giles foster seemed to be often confused that they were editing the music to the specialist .
if you want austen as you love her , look for the bbc logo ...
