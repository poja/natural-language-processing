this show is what happened to the screen savers after g4 got its hands on it , taking it from a useful source of computer-related information to a show that had as its high point the shoving of a miniature web server up someone 's posterior.as g4 's ratings plummeted , they moved away from their original target audience , gamers , to generic hormone-driven young men , adding eye candy to the staff and a sex advice segment .
now even the gamers who applauded the show initially are turning away in disgust .
i look forward to the show 's , and the network 's , overwhelmingly overdue and well-deserved demise .
