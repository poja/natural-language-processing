now and again , a film comes around purely by accident that makes you doubt your sanity .
we just finished studying the novel , `` northanger abbey '' , at school and decided to refresh our memory of this unexciting piece of humourless garbage with the bbc adaptation.the funny thing about northanger abbey is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself .
the film is nothing like the book , for example , the subtly evil characters seem to have been turned into transparent stereotypes .
john thorpe looks like a leprechaun on acid while isabella plays the role of slut .
catherine , the main character , is the most depressingly stupid and irritating actress on god 's earth ( she looks like a coffee addict , her eyes are like basketballs ) whilst mr tilney looks and acts like a retired porno stunt double .
the plot goes completely off the rails at certain points of the film , i do n't know what the hell the director was thinking when for no reason at all , a 7 year old black kid who we 've never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and starts cartwheeling in front of her .
yes , that 's right , cartwheeling .
nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by catherines `` fantasies '' in which she is being carried around a cathedral by an ogre.northanger abbey is basically visual euthanasia so if you want to murder your boss or something like that , bbc have basically discovered a new way to kill someone .
northanger is a barely laughably bad film .
do n't watch it unless you 're in a padded cell .
