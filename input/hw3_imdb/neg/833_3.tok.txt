this is a classic example of what happens when a sit com is on tv for far far too long .
everything gets tired and the jokes start getting repeated over and over again .
ok , from the start , the first couple of series were quite good .
you had an entertainment manager ( simon cadel ) being pursued by his deputy played by ruth madoc , a cleaning lady wanting to become a yellow coat , an alcoholic child-hating punch and judy man , a bent jockey , and a stand up comedian .
as said earlier , it started well but went on way too long .
once simon cadel left it went downhill fast , you were getting dire story lines , and a new entertainments manager who ruth madoc ( again ) threw herself at .
when a comedy is all filmed in one place there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be cracked .
unfortunately this went on so long every joke was cracked 3 or 4 times over .
if this comedy had been stopped after 2 series it would have gone down as an all time classic .
as it is , it will be largely remembered for the dreadful last few series .
