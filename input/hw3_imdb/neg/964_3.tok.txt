`` the snow queen '' is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by hans christian andersen , about a girl , gerda , who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend kai from the clutches of the snow queen .
this adaption attempts to capture that story 's sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design , but fails on a number of counts.like so many hallmark productions , the potential of the story is completely undercut by heavy-handed scripting and direction .
the two actors playing gerda and kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable ; bridget fonda as the snow queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role .
there 's a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering three-hour miniseries .
at least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story , particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main characters.that said , `` the snow queen '' would be just about ideal for pre-teens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience .
it 's great eye-candy without being scary , and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime over-the-top level that spells out the storyline in very , very bold text .
just make sure you read them andersen 's story too .
