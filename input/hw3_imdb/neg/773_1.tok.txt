stay away from this movie .
far away .
phil fondacaro stars as the demented ringleader of a freakshow .
every performance is flat and unfeeling , except fondacaro 's .
the plot is a simple one , and follows almost every horror movie cliche possible .
a group of high-school kids go to a carnival , see a side-show , and get in over their heads.fans of fred olen ray should be warned , this is not like any of his other films .
this one is lacking in all departments ( humor , sex , horror , etc . )
other f.o .
ray movies excell in.the version i saw also contained a making-of documentry , in which the director makes comments like `` we had a limited budget '' and `` with our limited timeline '' which speaks volumes about how much charles band cared about this film .
go rent `` droid runner '' ( fred olen ray ) or `` the dead hate the living '' ( full moon ) instead .
full moon should be ashamed of themselves ( and that 's saying a lot after seeing `` killer eye '' ) grade : d-
