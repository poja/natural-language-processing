i have seen previous movies from cédric klapisch , and therefore expected a quality movie with psychological depth .
having been an erasmus student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad , i know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time .
yes , it is great fun !
because of that i thought i should not miss this movie .
unfortunately i was disappointed to find that l'auberge espagnol fails to satisfy in many ways : the characters are stereotyped , the events are trite and the story is shallow .
although there are quite a few familiar situations , they are irritatingly cliché and do not go beyond the trivial events .
this made the movie uninteresting to watch , and gave me a strong `` been-there-done-that-don't-you-have-anything-to-add ? ''
feeling .
apart from that , the movie lacks a firm story .
it sometimes looks more like a documentary or 'real-life ' show than a seriously made movie.however , i can imagine that if you have n't studied or travelled abroad , this might be fun to watch .
