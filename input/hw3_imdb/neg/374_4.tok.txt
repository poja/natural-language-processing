although the story is good and portrayals what i expected of sam elliot my dvd copy contained almost unbearable synchronization problems .
the dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement throughout the whole film.i would therefore be very careful in purchasing any dvd of the film without checking for the problem.i would also follow the recommended censors classifications particularly in relation to language and drug usage.this film could become a silent classic cop movie and with the above cautionary notes i can recommend it to prospective viewers
