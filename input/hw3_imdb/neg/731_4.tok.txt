the preposterous premise of this flick has to do with argentina reclaiming the falkland islands , having failed through force in 1982 , by impregnating the european women inhabitants with argentinean sperm thereby diluting the ethnic purity until it favored argentina .
yeah , right .
the reconnaissance is done by our hero/villan and cad , fabian , who hauls his fish-eye camcorder from pillar to post secretly filming his encounters with the falklanders including his courting and eventual conquest of one woman , camilla .
an unfortunate indie and fraudulent documentary , this flick favors us with lots of boring tourism shot from the hip ... .yada , yada , yada .
the film has no plot potential and only begins to become interesting as fabian and camilla wend their way through the usual moments of awkwardness and uncertainty as they get from the handshake to the bed .
`` f*ckland '' is only for those cinema purists who can appreciate the bleak , no frills , jigglecam austerity of dogme indies .
