an italian/american co-production co-starring linda blair and david 'the hoff ' hasselhoff : how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat ?
well , based on the uneventful , extremely tedious , and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so , i would have said 'very easily ' ; thankfully , however , things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes , and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy , a smattering of nudity too ( unfortunately , my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material ) .the hoff stars as gary , a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend leslie ( leslie cumming ) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project , a book about witches ; whilst there , frustrated gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving leslie of her virginity.his plans for nookie are scuppered , however , by the unexpected arrival of property developers freddie and rose brooks ( robert champagne and annie ross ) , their pregnant daughter jane ( blair ) , son tommy ( michael manchester ) , pretty nymphomaniac architect linda sullivan ( catherine hickland ) , and estate agent jerry ( rick farnsworth ) , who have come to inspect the island 's hotel.after explaining their unexpected presence on the island , gary and leslie are welcomed by the property 's new owners , and when a violent storm suddenly picks up , making it perilous to return to the mainland , everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building .
unfortunately , unbeknownst to the hotel 's new guests , the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch ( hildegard knef ) , who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life .
one by one , victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex ( which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs ) , before meeting a terrible fate.none of this makes much sense , and the acting is atrocious ( manchester as tommy is particularly bad , whilst hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers , which speaks volumes about the others ) , but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore : rose has her lips sewn together , before being roasted alive in a fireplace ; jerry is crucified and burnt alive ; linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish ( !
! )
; freddie 's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood ; and gary gets stabbed in the back.oh , and leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and blair gets possessed ( again ) .
