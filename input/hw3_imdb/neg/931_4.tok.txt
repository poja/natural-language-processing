first there was tsui hark 's zu warriors ( 2001 ) , which is visually ground-breaking , but much lacking in the acting and writing departments , now this movie , which is visually almost as good as zu ( though no longer ground-breaking ) , but is even worse in the acting and writing departments .
it 's really sad that there seems to be an almost complete lack of acting and writing talents in the hk movie industry .
i guess you need to understand cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogs in the movie really are .
it 's like some delinquent kids talking in the street , it 's that bad .
to make it worse , the actors and actresses themselves look like delinquent kids , and ca n't act even if their life depend on it .
i understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in hk , but has hk youths really become so brain-dead that they ca n't appreciate anything but such juvenile and vulgar acting/writing ?
if that 's the case , it makes me ashamed to be from hk.i wish hk movie makers will learn some lessons from directors like zhang yi-mou or ang lee , and finally make a movie that 's both visually stunning as well as competent and mature in the acting and writing departments .
and stop using young singers/idols/heartthrobs as actors because they ca n't act however many fans they may have in hk !
