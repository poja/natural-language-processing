i 'm mike sedlak .
i co-wrote the score for this movie .
and proud of it .
and i love all of the comments .
some have not gone far enough.the movie premiered in san francisco in the summer of 1973. the theater was packed with friends and family .
we all clapped.five days latter , it was pulled from all of the screens in the bay area.if anyone is interested hearing some of scene by scene details , which might make the movie even more enjoyable , please let me know.we could start with the shot where gideon blake throws the toilet plunger to distract one of the evil henchmen guarding the radio transmitter on the deck of bud 's house .
or how gideon diffused the bomb in the original version.did n't help .
it still bombed.bring it on .
