in comparison to other `` sand and sandal '' fare , the egyptian leaves much to be desired .
the film is very loosely based upon mika waltari 's well researched novel , which centers around the egyptian physician sinhue 's adventures at the court of akhnaton as well as his travels throughout canaan , minoan crete and africa .
unfortunately , due to the moral strictures of the time , much of sinhue 's story ( which is rife with romantic and sexual exploits ) remains on the cutting room floor and instead , the audience is treated to reels and reels of victor mature 's wooden acting .
even gene tierney  a leading lady `` staple '' of the time  can not manage to look nor act her best in this flick and gives a rather somnambulistic performance which can only be justified by the fact that the actress was having some serious psychiatric problems at the time .
there is a great deal of rhetoric and theological machinations over the idea of monotheism vs. polytheism , but michael wilding is so tiring as the revolutionary akhnaton , that one is surely cheering for someone to off him and restore the old religion before the second reel .
my advice : buy the book from e-bay , rent something more entertaining like solomon and sheba and then call it a night !
