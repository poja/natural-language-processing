i do not know what some of these filmmakers are thinking , by making the same type of clich√©d film over and over , where the bad guys ( bad girls in this case ) win .
weak acting and very predictable .
nothing original about it .
this same movie has been made over and over again- not different from goodbye lover ( 1989 ) , slow burn ( 2005 ) , or at least ten other movies with the exact same storyline and ending .
there are a lot of holes in the movie too .
it is as if they ran out of money and just stopped filming .
or perhaps they ran out of ideas .
but do not waste your time with this one .
it will only leave you upset by having wasted your time watching it .
