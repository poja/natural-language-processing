while i am not a woman , i can enjoy a chick flick if its good .
this one however is beyond bad .
you have the by the book story , girl is getting divorced , boy with issues shows up .
boom magic happens and his demons are banished as she realizes her life has a new purpose.now while i can believe that kind of thing might happen , i am not an idiot .
it would n't happen over a weekend of geriatric rumpy-pumpy , it would take time .
yet here the producers know they only have 1 hour and 30 minutes so they force the changes of the two to happen , i suppose a night of getting hammered and a night of gramps and granny going at it like dogs in heat might be enough if you believed romance novels were the gospel ... but most people don't.now , if that is n't enough ... the producers remembered that a chick flick needs to make the viewer cry ... well they tried to make you cry with the two senior citizens getting jiggy with it by failed ... so how could they hit you again ?
why i know , lets kill off one of the characters for no good reason at all except that a random death will surely bring a tear to the eye ... .
and now lets have the teen daughter magically bond with heart broken mom for no reason besides the fact that it would be nice ( completely unreal , but who cares ) .so there you have it ... girl find boy , boy find love , death finds boy and mom cries ... .
what a movie - not .
