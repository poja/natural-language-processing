since this show was changed from tss ( the screen savers ) to aots ( attack of the show ) it has gone down hill .
tss with yoshi and kevin rose alex ... etc .
made the show awesome , then they got fired from tss for an unknown reason .
when the show switched to aots , it became less about computers , and more about gaming and magazines .
it also promoted bands that nobody had heard of , or cared about .
finally i could n't watch it anymore once kevin rose left .
he kept it interesting , but he went off to do his own thing , which is good .
kevin rose now has several online pod casts , and shows , etc on the rev 3 network .
check it out .
rev3.com i think , you can get to it by going to www.systm.org .
if you want a real tech show rather than aots , then go watch kevin roses shows or listen to the twit podcast.j <
