though the our gang comedies still have their followers , i 've got to say that their attempt to graduate to feature films , courtesy of hal roach came up way short .
why did roach have to pick the civil war as is subject with all the attendant racism that would follow.dashing southern cavalier phillips holmes takes in young orphan spanky mcfarland and his young black friend buckwheat thomas after spanky inadvertently exposes a card cheat on a riverboat .
all is placid and serene in the old south and then the civil war comes to ruin it for everybody.but even children can charm the worst in the world and there 's none worse than those damn yankees .
they just come south and ruin it for everybody.criticized though it was for its southern viewpoint , gone with the wind did make a good case for the southern cause and the blacks portrayed even though servile which they would be out of necessity are still three dimensional characters .
hattie mcdaniel would not have won her oscar if it were not so .
butterfly mcqueen 's character of prissy as silly and vacuous as she was has some dimension.here though is maybe some of the worst racial stereotyping ever brought forth in hollywood .
the companionship of spanky and buckwheat does show that kids get along , racial feelings are acquired not inbred .
it 's not the servility of the blacks that 's objectionable , but there total acceptance of it .
right from that horrible watermelon song , sung over the title credits , the message of general spanky is a bad one.yet it did get an oscar nomination for sound recording , probably one of the very few hal roach ever got out of the short subject field.general spanky is far from gone with the wind though .
