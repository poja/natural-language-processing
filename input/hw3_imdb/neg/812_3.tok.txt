outside sweden you are not expected have seen this movie .
happy you .
the cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the swedish movie history .
and still.. seems like peter dalle only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes .
robert gustafson is totally misused in this movie , trying to copy a younger g√∂sta ekman .
ekman , by the way , is the only actor fulfilling the expectations .
credit that can be given is for the photo , splendid idea using black and white .
music is ok.but over-all it 's a waste of god actors and the time of the audience .
