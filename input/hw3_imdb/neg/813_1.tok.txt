i had this movie given to me , and have to admit , i am glad that i did not pay money for it.the back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle , with 2 women trying to seduce her .
but the reality in this movie is far from that.in reality , the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters .
there was absolutely nothing in this that i found interesting at all.even movies like silence of the lambs and wild things ( which the box tries to compare this movie to ) were riveting , because of the unexpected turns and suspense.but jaded has none of this .
it concentrates on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them .
and the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims story is true.while it does show that same sex rape is possible , it is not a movie worth watching.if at all possible , pass this movie up at all costs .
