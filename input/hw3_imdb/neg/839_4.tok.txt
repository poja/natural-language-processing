there 's considerable amount of money behind this production , so the look of it is very good .
it includes some interesting appearances by gilbert roland , eddie burns , and a brief cameo at the beginning by christopher lee .
there are a few exciting gunfights , and a humorous bit or two - the satire on django , the man with no name , and sabata is amusing , especially when they are given the names of failed presidents of the mexico revolution.the trouble is , there is n't any purpose in satirizing the spaghetti western as is attempted here .
the key element in the spaghettis is irony , which easily blends into comedy ; in fact the source of all spaghetti 's is kurosawa 's yojimbo , which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time , and most spaghettis easily slipped over the edge into real comedy of a very sophisticated variety .
perhaps the best evidence of this is found in the trinity films , which are both openly spaghettis and openly slap-stick comedy .
so why bother satirizing a genre that - by its very nature - satirizes itself ?
consequently , i found the whole enterprise essentially unconvincing .
none of these characters were people i would ever care about , the story was generically clich√© , and the production values only reflected the money involved , not the passion of the director .
over all , a banal and futile effort to cash in on the phenomenon it mocks .
