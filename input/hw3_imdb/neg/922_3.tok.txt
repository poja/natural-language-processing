great ensemble cast but unfortunately a bunch of undeveloped ideas make the film drag .
one feels not fulfilled at the end after waiting for some kind of conclusion , closure , or at least an ironic twist.it had that familiar `` curb '' feel without dare i say it , larry as the annoying polar opposite .
the music was there , the 'show about nothing ' scenes pop up , but without any common thread or suspense - it falters as a solo project that ran out of budget.spoilers : the movie title speaks about cheese but she prefers the rice pudding .
is cheese a better selling title than rice pudding ?
he prefers just any junk food , regardless of the sell by date .
maybe i want someone to eat 'cheese-dogs ' or ice cream in a pirate suit would have at least tied some scenes together.marty : this is just not funny and overdone .
people just do n't care about a 'show ' within a show .
a coffee book table about coffee books was funnier.unless you are big fans of the cast , save your time and eat some cheese .
it does n't even have to be with anyone .
