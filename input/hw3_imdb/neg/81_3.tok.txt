okay , so it was never going to change the world , and it bombed at the box office , but honky tonk freeway is one of those films i fell in love with as a child ( the bbc showed it a few times during the 1980s and i happened to have a high quality vhs tape in the machine - lucky , that ! )
and watched endlessly .
i watched the dvd last night and sadly , time has not been kind to this would-be blockbuster .
either that or i 've just grown out of this kind of broad , dopey humour .
come on , when schlesinger is so desperate for laughs he gives us close-ups of novelty underpants with 'amusing ' slogans , what can you say about the cast or screenplay ?
certainly , it 's ambitious , interesting , unusual and sprawling , but it 's never once laugh-out-loud funny .
i 'd describe it as a children 's film with some 'adult ' overtones - you can safely let your youngsters watch this , despite the 15 certificate .
they wo n't get the drug references , so do n't worry about it .
i had a pleasant surprise when i realized i 'd forgotten just how catchy both the title song and the song-writing truck driver 's 'everybody 's going faster , faster ' song were , not to mention the town of ticlaw 's patriotic anthem .
the whole cast give commendable performances , the photography is crisp and captures the mood of the various locations perfectly , and there 's a real time capsule feeling about the fashions , the cars , the gadgets ( especially the dashboard-mounted drum machine ) , the interiors and the pop-culture references - i was more than a little surprised to hear the nutty bum in the bank loudly telling everyone `` i 'm oj simpson !
`` , particularly now simpson 's legal tangles have overshadowed his sporting achievements .
the snag is , there 's almost no plot to speak of , it 's way too obvious to be witty and not funny enough to elicit many genuine laughs .
i wish i 'd left this one as a pleasant memory .
