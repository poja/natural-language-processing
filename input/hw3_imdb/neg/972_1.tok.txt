there comes a time in every big name actor 's career when they get sloppy and accept projects that they would n't have touched with a 1000 ft. pole in their golden days .
remember `` taxi driver '' ?
that was a fine film .
i can hardly believe that the de niro of `` showtime '' is the same actor.i would rather watch `` time chasers '' twice than see this film again .
if anyone offers to take you to see `` showtime '' or gives you free passes , or whatever , run away as fast and far as you can .
