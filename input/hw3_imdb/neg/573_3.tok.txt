this is a movie about people receiving a love letter .
nobody knows who sent in and nobody knows who it is for .
a good cast , headed up by kate capshaw , tom selleck and ellen degeneres .
this , however , is a completely dopey plot .
as an example , the capshaw character , one of the leading citizens of a small town in new england , takes up with an immature college student who works in her bookstore during the summer .
she chooses him instead of tom selleck , the town firefighter who is crazy about her .
if that is n't the epitome of stupidity , i do n't know what is .
just an example of how dopey this movie is .
watching kate capshaw jog is a pleasure , but you immediately realize that she has never jogged a day in her life .
another obviously dopey part of a dopey movie .
