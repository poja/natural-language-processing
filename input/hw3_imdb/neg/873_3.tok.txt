*warning : 1 tiny inconsequential spoiler* you 're right .
this was no bridges of madison county .
as soon as the lonely woman and richard gere checked into the big empty hotel , it was a foregone conclusion something kind of fun would happen .
the question is : how will it come about ?
the answer is some stupid connect-the-dots story not worth sitting through .
in one supposed bonding experience , they get drunk and clean out the cupboard of old cans .
( that was my spoiler . )
and the next day they put them back .
lol it was n't compelling at all .
i 'm an old married lady like the one in the movie and my friendships are more interesting than her romance with richard gere .
lol .
.
.
it did have that advantage .
you walk away and go , oh brother .
.
.
even i could have written something more believable than that .
i guess my life is n't quite as dull as i thought it was if i can scoff at a romance with richard gere .
lol !
and that friend inherited that totally contemporary , probably computer-generated mansion , resting half in the ocean , from her grandmother who built it after the civil war ?
?
?
maybe her grandmother is oprah and this was way after the civil war ?
and yes , where was the email ?
what alternative universe do these people live in ?
i never want to see another movie that pretends we do n't have email , and facebook , and texting .
and ok , maybe these people have a horrible aversion to delivering news over the phone , but do n't ask me to believe anyone in this age of instant communication that someone just drops into your life without calling first .
