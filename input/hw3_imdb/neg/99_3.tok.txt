four things intrigued me as to this film - firstly , it stars carly pope ( of `` popular '' fame ) , who is always a pleasure to watch .
secdonly , it features brilliant new zealand actress rena owen .
thirdly , it is filmed in association with the new zealand film commission .
fourthly , a friend recommended it to me .
however , i was utterly disappointed .
the whole storyline is absurd and complicated , with very little resolution .
pope 's acting is fine , but owen is unfortunately under-used .
the other actors and actresses are all okay , but i am unfamiliar with them all .
aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie ( and pope and owen ) , this film is n't very good .
so the moral of the story is ... do n't watch it unless you really want to .
