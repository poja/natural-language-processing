i find herzog 's documentary work to be very uneven .
fata morgana , a companion piece of sorts to lessons of darkness , lacks not only the harrowing spectacle but mostly the discerning eye of an author .
it is by comparison amateur looking , aimless pans left and right across the desert the kind of which you would expect from any german tourist equipped with a handycam , the camera left running from the window of a car picking up all kinds of meaningless images , wire fences , derelict buildings and patches of dirt going through the lens in haphazard order , intercut with shots of sand dunes .
at one point herzog encounters a group of starved cattle rotting away in the sand , yet the image is presented much like you and me would , perhaps worse , the camera peering hand-held from one cattle to the next .
for a documentary that attempts to be a visual feast , a hypnotic , surreal excursion in uncharted landscapes , it lacks the visual orchestration and conviction of a disciplined author .
it 's all over the place , half-hearted and tedious , mayan creation myths recited in voice-over , then some other text herzog fancied for literature .
it 's not until near the end that fata morgana jumps alive through a series of bizarre encounters .
first with a man and a woman playing music in a room , the man singing in a distorted voice through a mic , both of them apathetic in their task .
a man holding up a turtle .
a group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the ground .
other than that , this one seems to have very little of substance to offer or visual splendor to offer .
