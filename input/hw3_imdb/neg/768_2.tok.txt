tom & jerry are visiting africa and disguise themselves in an `` amos-n-andy '' fashion .
they even act and talk differently , with the standard degrading usage of extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotypical image of blacks portrayed in many cartoons of the era .
aside from the offensive images , this cartoon just is n't very good .
why were they going to africa in the first place ?
apparently just to provide the audience with another amos-n-andy and the additionally overused cannibalistic portrayal of native africans .
the only reason this got a 2 instead of a 1 was there is a decent few seconds involving an octopus.worth one view , which will still leave you shaking your head wondering how ignorance could prevail ... ( note .
i consider some cartoons containing such racially stereotypical images very good .
it all depends on if there is good content surrounding the cartoon , or if the only reason for the existence of the cartoon is to make fun of those incorrectly portrayed .
in other words , if you get rid of `` mammy , '' shuffling feet , the poor grammar , and black-face with giant lips images is there anything left ?
in the case of `` plane dumb '' there is not . )
