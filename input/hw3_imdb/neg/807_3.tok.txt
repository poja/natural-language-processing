arthur hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man ( probably the ozarks ) who goes hunting with his favorite coon dog .
however , the dog appears to be drowning when hunnicutt jumps in after him .
it becomes obvious pretty soon that despite hunnicutt and his dog roaming about after leaving the water that they both died in the water -- as no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dog 's death .
yet , oddly , hunnicutt is really slow on the uptake and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him !
i think this was actually done as padding , as there really was n't enough material to fill the half hour time slot.later , in the `` surprise twist '' , he comes upon heaven -- or at least his concept of the place .
he 's invited in , but since they wo n't allow dogs , he has other ideas !
overall , reasonably well acted but of dubious spiritual value !
with no twists or irony , this episode is a bit dull -- not `` twilight zone-y '' enough for my tastes .
