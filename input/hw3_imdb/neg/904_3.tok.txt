a 10 year old kid fed up with his parents arguing decides to hot wire a car and go on a surreal journey across america to find motorama cards , which is a gas station card game , that if he can find to spell out `` motorama '' he has a chance to win 500 million dollars .
he meets many bizarre characters along the way .
no one can make an 'instant cult classic ' , joe minion 's previous `` after hours '' achieved that by sheer merit & an amazing director , but it was n't instant .
this movie , on the other hand , is just bizarre just to be bizarre .
no rhyme or reason to any of it .
the plot is incidental at best and seems to exist just to showcase various cameos .
it 's just not a fun film nor a thoughtful one .
it 's way too slapped together .
i 've heard many comparisons between this and david lynch films .
that 's damn near heresy as even lynch 's 'worst ' film ( worst in quotes , as he does n't have an bad films really ) is still miles above this dreck .
