young spinster , who does n't associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set , invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day .
nervous and overly-polite to hide her own sexual insecurities , she is most pleased when the boy makes himself to home in her guest bedroom ... but not so happy when he begins sneaking out the window at night .
sandy dennis is not a hapless actress , but why she was attracted to these sad-sack roles i guess we 'll never know .
based on a book by richard miles , and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could get , this lurid material not only attracted dennis but also director robert altman ( whose work is static , at best ) .
the narrative seems almost a sex-reversal of `` the collector '' , a tag which may have sold the film-rights but which does n't turn out to be a good idea cinematically .
even the film 's best sequence ( dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner ) does n't quite come off , with sandy acting both ill and indignant ( whose idea was this plan ? )
.
michael burns is quite good as the kid who uses this frumpy , pasty-sick woman just for her comfy digs , but he 's handled too bashfully by altman , with lots of strategically-placed towels and flesh-colored undies ( altman clearly was n't ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point ) .
sandy dennis has a handful of very good scenes ; she does n't chatter away mindlessly here , she thinks before she speaks and she 's alarmingly careful in her actions .
unfortunately , the role itself is a bummer , with an apparent slide into mental deterioration which seems to happen off-screen .
as such , the abrupt finale is maddening , and the overall results tepid .
