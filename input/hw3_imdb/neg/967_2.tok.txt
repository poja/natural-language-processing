for all intents and purposes , showtime was the worst movie i have ever seen.why ?
because having deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie .
i had also made the mistake of watching 48 hours and beverly hills cop recently before seeing showtime and for some strange reason thought eddie murphy was still funny .
well he 's not .
in fact it almost seems like he has been neutered .
as i watched this movie i was in amazement that deniro decided this was a good enough script to lend his name too .
no chemistry between him and murphy whatsoever .
horrible writing , horrible jokes , a movie that you think is supposed to be good ca n't get much worse than this .
not too long after sitting through the wretch that was showtime i happened to watch national security starring martin lawrence .
the movie had its funny parts but was n't that great .
but still it was 20 times better than showtime .
please if your a deniro fan do not watch this movie !
