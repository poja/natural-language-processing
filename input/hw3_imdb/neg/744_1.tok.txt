northanger abbey is not my favorite jane austen novel , but it has its charms .
this movie does n't .
it has some of the same character names as the book , but the story is drastically altered , and the sweetest man in the whole austen canon ( unless emma 's mr. knightley gets pride of place ) is made out to be a heartless and mercenary creep .
one or two totally extraneous characters are introduced , and a palpable air of corseted perversion hangs over it all .
i was so disappointed when i first saw it on its release in 1986 ; even today it ranks high on the list of films that disgrace the books on which they 're based .
even robert hardy fans should give this one a wide berth .
it has nothing , and i mean n-o-t-h-i-n-g , to recommend it .
