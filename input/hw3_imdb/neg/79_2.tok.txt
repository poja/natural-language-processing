no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
this is not a film , this is an excuse to show people dancing .
this is just not good .
even the dancing is slow and not half as entertaining as the mediocre 'dirty dancing ' , let alone any other good dance movie.is it a love story ?
is it a musical ?
is it a drama ?
is it a comedy ?
it 's not that this movie is a bit of all , it 's that this movie fails at everything it attempts to be .
the film turns out to be even more meaningless as the film progresses.acting is terrible from all sides , the screenplay is definitely trying to tell us something about relationship but fails miserably.watch for the moment - when patrick stewart enters the scene and you think the film might get better as he brightens up the dull atmosphere .
for a second .
