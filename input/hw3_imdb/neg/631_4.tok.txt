not a terrible movie ... but there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing - not a good thing for a action/thriller .
the acting is generally pretty decent for a scifi channel movie .
barry corbin plays a credible us senator , and lou diamond phillips again gives us a decent military/police/sheriff/agent/marshal figure .
the special effects are well , `` special '' - for example , the external train shots are very obviously a model train.goofs : a meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene .
the car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch .
after the impact , the meteor is lodged in the top of the car 's hood - impossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at.spoilers ... a good portion of the movie 's events are predictable , from the helicopter crash ( `` pull up , pull up !
`` ) , to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end , to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train , to the sequel set-up at the end.the scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious .
they are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speed - remember the monty python rabbit ?
spoiler goof : in one scene four people shooting clip after clip can not hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed .
later in the movie todd bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range .
on several occasions , lou diamond phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands .
