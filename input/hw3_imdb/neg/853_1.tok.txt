when i first looked at the back of the cover of this film , it seemed like me and my friends could be looking forward to 82 memorable minutes .
and it certainly was memorable .
puckoon was the kind of movie where you keep asking yourself how this was possible .
how it was possible that it was released on dvd at all .
out of all of the movies available at the video rental store that night ... we might just have picked the worst .
and yes , they had tomb raider .
absolutely nothing in this movie amused me even slightly .
who came up with the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story by suggestions from the main character ?
out of all the stupid things you can totally ruin a movie with , this is now my favourite .
the character foggerty , the village idiot , played by nickolas grace is the most annoying character since they started making movies in color .
if there is one single movie that you definately not should see this year , please let it be puckoon , cause i do n't think it can be any worse .
i still wonder if this just might have been the worst way i have spent my money , and take my word for that i have made many lousy purchases over the years .
