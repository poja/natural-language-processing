i think downey was perhaps inspired by french new-wave.who was n't ?
unfortunately , what he ended up creating here was more along the lines of crackhead new-wave.a synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and downey appears to have lost plenty .
just say no , indeed .
in more ways than one .
including to watching this film.i could n't bear it after a while and began fast forwarding through it .
it would have been wiser to have just skipped it altogether .
