in all honesty , i have n't seen this film for many years , but the few times i have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory , as anyone who has seen it will understand .
i first saw it as a child at a ymca halloween party in the early sixties , and it scared the hell out of us kids , in a fun way .
i remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze .
i ca n't risk giving away the ending , except to say that it was surprising , to say the least .
i remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler , followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed .
the ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history , and yet oddly moving , in a way .
you have to see it for yourself , which is not easy these days .
i do n't know if it 's available on home video or not , but it would still make a great halloween feature for both kids and adults .
