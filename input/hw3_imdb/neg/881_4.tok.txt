richard gere and diane lane star in a chick flick romance with the sort of ending i get really angry about ... lets just say its not my cup of tea , just like the dime store romances are not my cup of tea.the plot has a doctor stopping at an inn and meeting a woman that he has a deep but brief affair with .
he goes off to meet his estranged son and she goes back to her life.well acted and well made the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line .
this is the stuff of dime store romances that makes the women swoon and the men shake their head in disbelief .
i would n't be so adverse to the film as a mindless romance , except that the film takes a turn in the final reel that is so out of left field as to be completely unbelievable .
why must certain types of movies do stupid things like this ?
it really ruined it for me.if you like romance give it a shot , though wait for cable .
