i saw this movie a while ago and i was looking forward to it .
my biggest problem was having seen the trailer i was expecting a very stylish marshal arts movie with plenty of action and maybe a bit of plot to think about along the way .
i was sorely disappointed as it would seem that once you have seen the trailer there is nothing else worth watching ( if what you are expecting is as described above ) .
my girlfriend at the time gave up half way through and whilst i continued to watch in the hope that something interesting might happen ... nothing did .
i found no attachment or real interest in any of the characters .
i would say just do n't bother unless you have a few hours of your life that you do n't really care about losing .
