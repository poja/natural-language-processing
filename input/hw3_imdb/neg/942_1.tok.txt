i see absolutely nothing funny -- -even remotely funny -- -in this stupid movie .
an unrealistic , silly , ridiculous idea -- just completely ridiculous .
hard to believe that the main character , who seems so articulate , intelligent and imaginative , would not be accepted to any college .
even more difficult to believe is that no one shut the place down .
the actors portrayed characters straight out of characterville .
we have seen their lot many a time over in many films .
nothing new here .
i found it on late night tv , and since there was really nothing else on , i watched the whole boring , stupid film .
what a total waste .
maybe if you are a teenager , you may find it amusing .
films are made for an immature mind , so teens , go for it .
the rest , no way .
