excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal .
it is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because i try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing .
in the case of `` full ride '' , the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story ; i was too busy ( during first and only viewing ) alternating between laughter and nausea.fortunately for most individual members of the cast , pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak , the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting .
riley smith and meredith monroe are at least well matched physically , finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters.unfortunately the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes smith and monroe 's staggering lack of talent .
on the positive side , they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutter.better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age .
the basic story is not particularly original , just another variation on `` an officer and a gentleman '' , but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of `` teenage '' actors.then again , what do i know ?
i 'm just a child .
