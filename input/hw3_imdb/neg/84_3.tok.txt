seeing the title of this movie `` stupid teenagers must die '' made me believe this was a spoof of some kind .
i discovered later on the original title was `` blood and guts '' .
both titles are misleading , though .
this is not a spoof , neither a serious splatter movie .
this is something in between , failing in both areas .
a group of teenagers is attending a s√©ance at a spooky house and then the killing starts .
sounds over familiar , does n't it .
well , this movies adds nothing whatsoever to the endless stream of similar movies .
and it is badly made .
because of the lack of light the entire film is grainy .
now this effect can be highly effective , but it is n't in this case .
the young cast is n't acting too badly , but the director has no clue as what to do with actors .
in numerous scenes the actors are clearly waiting for directions , but these are given too late .
it could also be an editor 's mistake , of course .
the characters are unrealistic and the story line just stinks .
the sound is terrible at times : conversations are undecipherable , but when talking loudly or screaming the actors are very loud indeed.this is not the worst horror movie i have ever seen , but it still is a bad one .
for me a 3 out of 10 .
