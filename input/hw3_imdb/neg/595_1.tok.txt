let 's see , cardboard characters like muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped .
you 'll be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their just deserts !
turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another world ... .the world of religious fantasy !
-- complete with cardboard demons who look like they are made of papier mache .
everybody gets dragged off to hell except for one poor chap who goes to heaven where he can presumably spend eternity with the blockheads that created this masterpiece of the absurd .
i think i 'd opt for hellfire myself .
go see something else , unless you are stoned , in which case , you might actually like it !
could n't hurt !
