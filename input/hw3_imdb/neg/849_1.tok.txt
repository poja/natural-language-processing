italian rip off of mandingo and the drum is a badly dubbed italian life on the plantation yarn .
lots of people who do n't look like they belong in the american south wear badly tailored costumes and wander around locations that look nothing like the american south .
the plot has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman , the jealousy that ensues and the tragedy that follows .
the film promises hot steamy sex and lots of twisted violence but nothing ever really comes of any of it , its all tease .
its all probably racially insensitive , i could n't notice since its artistically bankrupt .
the final twist is at best laughable .
a major turkey .
