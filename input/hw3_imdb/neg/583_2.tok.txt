our gang got one chance at a feature film in its 22 year history , and this was the best that could be done ?
it 's boring , forced and pointless , and i must respectfully disagree with the other poster on this film ; the 1994 little rascals remake was better than this .
almost anything is .
the kids are subordinate to the civil war proceedings ; it does n't feel like an our gang film at all , but like a humorless second-rate shirley temple clone .
