i say this .
if you want to see art , you go to an art gallery .
if you want to see a movie , you go to a theater .
trying to intertwine art and film proves disastrous in `` where the heart is '' .
an interesting cast is totally wasted in this embarrassment .
you like dabney coleman , see `` short time '' .
you like crispin glover , see `` bartleby '' .
you like uma thurman , see `` kill bill '' .
above all , if you like christopher plummer , see `` the silent partner '' , because his character here , is a terrible embarrassment .
in fact this entire production is an embarrassment .
sure the human artwork is intriguing for a few minutes , so make a short , but do not subject an audience to pointless nonsense , masquerading as filmed entertainment .
