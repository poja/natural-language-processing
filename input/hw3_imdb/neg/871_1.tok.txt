this movie is the final straw .
as two dedicated fans of the romantic comedy , this movie has finally made us realise that nothing good has come out of this genre since love actually .
there was nothing good about the film whatsoever .
it was an affront to love , death and everything in between .
including horses and beaches .
there was absolutely no chemistry between the characters .
this movie took the spark out of nicholas sparks .
diane lane can not act to save her life .
she was unconvincing in her laugh , cry , and dance .
and she needs a better haircut .
there is no reason to watch this movie .
save yourself .
the romantic comedy is officially dead .
