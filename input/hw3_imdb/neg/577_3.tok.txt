i must be honest , i like romantic comedies , but this was not what i had hoped for .
i thought ellen degeneres was having the biggest part , which should have been , because i did n't like the two struggling bed partners .
it was awful .
poor tom selleck !
!
he had to act with someone who was that much in the picture while it should have been him and ellen to be in most of the film .
they were the only believable ones .
and the only really funny parts starred them , not kate capshaw and that everett guy.. cool that mummy is coming out of the closet , i thought that was a nice surprise .
i 'm just glad i saw it on the cable and i did n't pay any money renting it..
