armoredthe best part about driving an armored vehicle is that if any bums approach you at a red light asking for money , you can shoot them in the face.and while the armoured guards in this thriller are n't using their protective power to purge the drifter population , they are using their position to fleece their employer.when newcomer ty ( columbus short ) lands a job with an armored trunk company , he feels like he has found his lot in life .
unfortunately , however , when he discovers that his co- workers ( matt dillon , jean reno and laurence fishburne ) are plotting to take the $ 42 m shipment for themselves , ty must fortify himself  and the funds  inside the armored truck.a tedious caper with a plodding plot and phoned-in performances , armored is an utterly forgettable film.besides , if you really want to jack millions , it 's a lot simpler to just disguise yourself as an atm .
