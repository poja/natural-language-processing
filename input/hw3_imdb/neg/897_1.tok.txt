a long time ago , way back in the early '80s , a late-night tv show `` fridays '' came to abc , trying to steal the limelight away from nbc 's badly-listing `` saturday night live '' .
it did n't but it did introduce some repugnant sketches and semi-talented `` comedians '' to the world .
like mark blankenfield , for example.which , in a roundabout way , brings us to `` jekyll and hyde ... together again '' .
which is repugnant in ways all its own.blankenfield is about as subtle as a pew full of whoopee cushions going off after communion .
and about as tasteful , too .
this is just his drugged-out druggist character he played on the ill-fated `` fridays '' show stretched out to feature length .
and if you did n't like him there , why are you reading this review ?
any time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie , that 's a bad sign .
then when it goes for dunder-headed jokes that would get you thrown off every improv stage in the western hemisphere and replaces gags with gross-out , things can only get worse.a comic take on a robert louis stevenson story ?
about as good an idea as making a sitcom out of poe 's `` fall of the house of usher '' .aside from a few ( very few ) gags that give a slight grin , this whole film is an exercise in waste - wasted actors , wasted film , wasted opportunities.no wonder they showed original author stevenson turning in his grave .
what more observant a review could they give themselves ?
no stars .
no , not even for armstrong , who should have known better .
`` hyde '' from this one .
