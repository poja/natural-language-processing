if you like bad movies , this one 's a real treat .
kaufman & peters stagger around in robot costumes , escape slavery only to wander aimlessly , and find true robot love .
i believe this is the first movie that ever made me consider walking out .
i should note i was 12 , and could be entertained by shiny objects .
