someone else called this film a `` fable-horror '' movie , and i think that fits pretty well .
that 's the concept at least .
a group of teenagers , each with their own vice , catch the eye of a twisted sideshow barker .
he decides to teach the teens a lesson by making them part of the freak show .
a cool idea , but could have been executed better .
the fate for some of the teens is shoved in your face too obviously , while other characters could have been fleshed out more .
also , the ending was a serious let down .
no resolution or big twist or anything .
but as a low budget horror movie , it 's pretty fun to watch .
if you 're into cheesy spookfests , you should have a laugh watching this one .
i think one of it 's faults though ... that it takes itself too seriously .
it 's a silly movie , and if it was a little more self-aware when it comes to that , i think it would have been better .
but at least there 's enough neat carnival themes and b-movie monster makeup to keep you watching .
