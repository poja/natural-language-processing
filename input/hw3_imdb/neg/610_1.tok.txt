this show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar slob with the pretty ( and sometimes shrewish-seeming ) wife and crazy in-law ( s ) .
with this show , it 's fat unfunny comedian kevin james as doug hefferman who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service .
he has a pretty wife , carrie ( leah remini ) , who works as legal assistant , and senile father-in-law , arthur spooner ( jerry stiller ) , who lives in his daughter and son-in-law 's basement .
kevin james ' doug is your typical beer drinking , sports loving , tv watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues .
he also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this show 's couple .
beyond the few laughs supplied by jerry stiller 's crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny .
kevin james ' imbecilic behavior usually caused the show 's problems that usually resolved by his wife .
this show continued a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid father/husband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on abc for some reason .
