seriously , i do n't understand how justin long is becoming increasingly popular .
he either has the best agent in hollywood , or recently sold his soul to satan .
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen , he has little to no charisma , and terrible comedic timing .
the only film that he has attempted to anchor that i 've remotely enjoyed was waiting ... and that is almost solely because i 've worked in a restaurant .
but i digress .
aside from it 's terrible lead , this film has loads of other debits .
i understand that it 's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy , but that does n't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence , and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive .
lewis black 's considerable talent is wasted here too , as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained , which the pg-13 rating certainly wo n't allow .
the film 's sole bright spot was jonah hill ( who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim ) .
his one liners were funny on occasion , but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable .
if you just want to completely turn your brain off ( or better yet , do n't have one ) then maybe you 'd enjoy this , but i ca n't recommend it at all .
