`` riders of destiny '' was the first of several westerns wayne made for the lone star arm of monogram pictures between 1933 and 1935. in this entry , the producers try to make the duke into a singing cowboy called `` singin ' sandy saunders with hilarious results .
any wayne fan knows that the duke could n't have carried a tune if his life had depended on it .
his voice was apparently dubbed by smith ballew whose deep baritone sounds nothing like wayne .
wayne looks awkward and uncomfortable in `` performing '' the musical numbers .
thank heavens the singing cowboy experiment soon ended.as for the movie itself , it contains a standard `` b '' western plot of the fight over water rights between the villain ( forrest taylor ) and the local ranchers .
duke , of course plays the hero .
he had not yet developed his on screen character and still looked like a poverty row cowboy.also cast in the film were george ( pre-gabby ) hayes as the heroine 's father , cecilia parker as the heroine and yakima canutt as `` one of the boys '' who performs his `` falling from the racing horses under the wagon '' stunt while doubling wayne .
both canutt and hayes would go on to appear with wayne in most of the other entries in the series .
canutt , in particular would have a profound effect on wayne 's future development teaching him , among other things , how to move , fight and look comfortable on a horse.as `` b '' westerns go this one is n't too bad , however , i have to give it a failing grade because of the `` singing '' .
