oh , well i thought it should be a good action , but it was not .
although jeff speakman stars there is nothing to watch.only two fight for almost 1,5 hours , yak.a lot of talking and everything is so artificial that you could not believe it .
the plot is clear from the beginning .
if you want good action do n't rent this movie .
