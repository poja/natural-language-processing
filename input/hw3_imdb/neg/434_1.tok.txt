one of two movies i have actually thought about asking for money to stay until the end .
most movies have at least one thing that is worth staying for , even if it just to laugh at how bad it is .
i never found it for this movie .
nothing was good , from the script , to the very bad effects .
the worst movie i have ever seen .
