i liked most of the dialogue , i liked the cast , i thought it was well acted .
i particularly enjoyed ellen degeneres ' perfect deadpan performance.what did n't work for me was : ( 1 ) the drawn-out affair with the younger man ( too long , too seemingly out of character for helen ) , ( 2 ) the seemingly endless cinematic cliches , mostly visual but including interminable voiced over re-readings of the love letter itself ( its contents should have a mystery ) ; ( 3 ) a young woman feminist-scholar and , ironically , a fireworks scene ( no wonder this reminded me of that horrid how to make an american quilt movie ) ; ( 4 ) the bumbling `` gotcha '' cop who smells `` dope '' everywhere ( no cliche there either ! )
; and ( 5 ) a nauseatingly romanticized small town setting.i would have preferred the film to more persuasively explore the source of ( or even glorify ) helen 's bitterness , to have included much more of degeneres ' character , to have eliminated or reduced the various intergenerational artifices , and to be a little less uncritical of small town life.had it been developed as a play first , those criticisms might have been addressed before committing the material to this film , which unfortunately is decidedly mediocre .
