opening with some blatantly reused footage from 'kit for cat ' , 'tweety 's s.o.s ' fails to live up to that classic cartoon .
instead , we get an example of friz freleng 's tweety and sylvester series at its most generic .
unlike chuck jones 's road runner series , which strived to introduce new jokes to the same setting , freleng 's series seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place .
'tweety 's s.o.s ' , then , basically amounts to `` this time let 's put 'em on a boat '' .
it 's not an entirely weak cartoon .
there are a few good jokes , mostly involving granny 's glasses , but they are outweighed by gags you can see coming a mile off ( the seasickness routine ) and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than tweety says `` i tawt i taw a putty tat '' , a joke that worked well once but has diminishing returns .
'tweety 's s.o.s ' will probably please children who enjoy virtually any cartoon but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags it 's definitely one to avoid .
