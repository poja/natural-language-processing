tom and jerry are transporting goods via airplane to africa .
but being white men , they 're worried they wo n't be safe , so they put on blackface to fit in .
once they 're wearing it , they adopt black dialect and fully inhabit their new characters .
they crash into the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft .
before reaching land , they suffer the advances of an over-affectionate octopus and more serious danger from sharks , a swordfish and a whale .
once on land , they 're frightened by fantastic creatures , and duck into a cave .
inside it 's even worse when they encounter living skeletons in blackface .
and upon exiting the cave , things are even worse than that when they are discovered by cannibals .
`` plane dumb '' is an especially sloppy effort from van beuren studios .
one example : a lion , unknown to tom and jerry , enters the cave before they do .
but the animators must have forgotten about it , because the lion never appears again .
another example is the ending that 's not an ending : it 's just an arbitrary stop.according to a youtube poster , the cartoon `` was originally intended to feature the voices and caricatures of a popular 'negro ' comedy team known as miller & lyles .
but aubrey lyles died of tuberculosis before the recording session was completed , and co-directors john foster & george rufle were forced to rework the animation into a 'tom & jerry ' story .
`` they should n't have bothered .
the crude animation and poorly-executed gags make the film a loser from beginning to end .
