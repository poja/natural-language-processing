not like i went in expecting a lot out of it , but i was at least hoping for a fun dumb big budget movie .
this is n't even that .
this item ranks in the bottom half of all the vampire movies i 've ever seen ( and believe me , i 've seen a lot of them ) .
bad acting , zero characterization , little to no thought , almost non-existent plot ( and that that 's there you can drive semi-trucks through the holes in ) .
sure , it has action and is loud , and has more action , and more noise , and blood , and action ... these things alone do not make a good ( or even halfway decent ) movie .
beats me how some people can say this is the best vampire movie ever made -- all i can assume is they have n't seen many .
i suggest seeing near dark instead .
