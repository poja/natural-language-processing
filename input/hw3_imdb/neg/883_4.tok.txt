if you read the book before seeing the movie you may be disappointed like i was .
the book was great and i was sure after seeing the movie preview that the movie would be great as well , however i felt like i was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters where like .
the movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates .
even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense .
i think both diane lane and richard gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry however they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they longed for each other .
the book was true love story and i think this movie could of been a lot better .
