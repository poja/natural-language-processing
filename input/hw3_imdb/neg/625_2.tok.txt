when i was 8 years old , and going through my marx brothers phase , my father read in the tv guide that they were showing the marx brothers film , `` the big store '' late on friday night , and set the vcr to tape it for me .
when i woke up on saturday -- due no doubt to a misprint in the tv guide -- my father and i discovered `` the story of mankind '' had been recorded instead .
`` the big store '' was probably one of the least funny of all the marx brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the century 's finest works of cinema when compared with `` the story of mankind . ''
i can almost justify tv guide 's error , in that the marx brothers -- groucho , chico , and harpo -- appear in both movies .
although in `` the story of mankind , '' they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes : groucho plays peter minuit , chico plays some guy talking to christopher columbus , and harpo plays isaac newton ?

harpo 's scene lasts about half a minute ; chico only has two or three lines ; groucho 's scene is at least funny , but horribly racially insensitive by today 's standards .
the rest of the movie does n't bear mentioning .
they trotted out some of the finest actors of the day , and made them recite total garbage .
what a disappointment.tv guide , i sent you a nice letter , i 'm still waiting for an apology.for the record : `` the big store '' has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the marx brothers on roller skates , and a couple of songs by virginia o'brien .
i was really looking forward to seeing it .
