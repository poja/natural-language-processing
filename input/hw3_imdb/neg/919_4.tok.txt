this film is about a struggling actor trying to find satisfaction in life , especially love which he has not had a taste of for 5 years.it basically is a film featuring a man with very poor social skills , and he says wrong things all the time .
the plot is hollow and contrived .
the main character , james , is lonely , but this theme of loneliness is not adequately explored .
it is more like an empty statement which other subplots stem from .
sadness and disappointment after being dumped are superficial .
there is a serious lack of emotions in the film.it is not funny as a comedy either .
there are some funny one liners but that is it .
it lacks the happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with happy mood .
i do n't find `` i want someone to eat cheese with '' funny .
