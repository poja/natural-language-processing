drab , dreary and a total waste of my time .
the plot is incomprehensible ( so do n't think about it too much ) .
the acting is odd and wooden - i would have sworn that they were all professional body builders trying their luck at acting , but that might be an insult to body builders .
there are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster , but lots of fires , explosions , a gratuitous sex scene , etc .
the only thing that caught my attention was that it takes place after a war between the us and iraq that somehow goes nuclear ... hmmm .
is roger corman psychic ?
let 's hope that `` iraq '' was just a lucky choice for corman and that the rest of his scenario does n't come true .
