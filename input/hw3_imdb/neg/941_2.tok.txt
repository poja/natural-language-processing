inane , awful farce basically about a young man who refuses to conform or better uses non-conformity to attain his objectives-fool his parents into thinking that he is attending a college .
truth is that this jerk has been rejected by every school he has applied to .
after viewing this junk , you will see why.what a ridiculous name- south hampton institute of technology .
you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the initials of this school of nonsense .
problem with these type of films is that in the end , the non-conformist becomes the accepted mode.let 's step back to the world of reality and call this film what it really is- excessive manipulative junk !
