divorced single mom in picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows it to spur into action her dormant love life .
pet project for actress/co-producer kate capshaw , who gives a warm , nicely-modulated lead performance , yet this story is so slim and the direction and editing so erratic that a faint dissatisfaction creeps in .
initially , capshaw 's helen envisions several of her friends reading the love letter to her ( an interesting visual joke ) but the first person they do this ploy with is ellen degeneres , who does n't play a lesbian but who comes off as one because of this gimmick .
different ideas are flayed about in the hopes that one would stick , and the continuity is extremely choppy .
supporting cast ( including tom selleck and tom everett scott , who mostly acts with his shirt off ) is very good , but they ca n't save the final act , which is disappointing .
low-keyed , in a quirky , pleasant way , but it is blandly good-natured , nothing more .
