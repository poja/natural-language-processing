i 'm usually a fan of `` art '' and `` foreign '' films , but when i saw this one my reaction was `` it must be called experimental because it makes no sense . ''
the `` action '' is static , while at the same time it bounces from one location to another .
there are n't enough titles to make it clear who is who and what their relationships are .
apparently the main point was to show that in the face of murder , adultery and generally weird and dissolute behavior , the cure offered by the powers that be is to banish a totally innocent black man .
