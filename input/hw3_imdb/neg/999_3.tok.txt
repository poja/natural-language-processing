the basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois .
fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this , using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists , invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience.it 's really rather messy though .
fellowes does n't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged .
rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves.the dialogue is inconsistent , stagey here , vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clich√©-landmine .
though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score ca n't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces .
there 's also a very prosaic , dare i say it british feel to the filming .
i did n't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation , i wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.finally it is , in fact , the story which lets the rest down .
just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes , woven as a vehicle for character examination .
wilkinson and watson support this meta-essay with good performances and john warnaby 's ebullient colleague simon to wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing.i 'm disappointed ; not that it 's bad , but that it could have been much better .
