this is probably the most uninvolving film i 've ever seen .
i watched it because i have a soft spot for leon ( everything else besson has done has been just awful , in my opinion , with the exception of the script for wasabi ) and jean reno .
it 's a testament to just how bad this film is that reno , one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable actors ( admittedly he 's just starting out here ) ca n't make this film , or the moments in which he is on screen , watchable.it 's all very film-schooly : black and white , no dialogue , people doing things for no apparent reason , people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera .
and , predictably , none of it is entertaining.it 's not a `` french mad max '' as some people have claimed ( actually , i think they mean `` mad max 2 '' ) - that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting , and is just the kind of comment you 'd expect from someone who does n't know what they 're talking about .
mad max 2 was pulsating , mad max 2 was exciting , mad max 2 was worth your time - le dernier combat is none of these.i know it 's supposed to be cool to like arty black-and-white french films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not ( or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy ) , which is why i would n't trust anyone who claims to like le dernier combat , because i see nothing of worth in it whatsoever ; it asks for so much and gives nothing back .
i found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention .
anyone who can sit through it undistracted is n't human , or , at the very most , is psychotic .
( actually , they 're probably just trying to seem `` cool '' ) .
