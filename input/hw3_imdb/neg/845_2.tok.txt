in 4 words , captain corelli 's mandolin was `` completely out of tune '' with the book .
the novel provided sufficient character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges the characters needed to overcome ; the script writer chose to ignore the details .
in ignoring them ( e.g .
the priest 's role initially as a buffoon , but later as a spiritual leader , the fiancee 's inability to read until taught by a socialist rebel , the bomb experts advice to corelli and his eventual ironic demise ) , the story and characters fall flat.this was the first movie that i 've ever walked out of midway through .
interesting cinematography , great actors do not make a film ; the story does .
