a horrible , horrible , horrible film .
i saw the original when i was a kid and it gave me nightmares into my teens .
when i found out a remake was on the way , i groaned .
why oh why remake a good film ?
well , we can thank dark castle for buggering yet another classic horror film .
this time they 've replaced a somewhat interesting story with gore , slower than slow pacing , and yawn-inspired characters .
someone previously said that s/he was surprised that paris hilton can act .
uh , were you watching the film ?
she plays a prissy little tramp .
sounds like typecasting to me .
half of the people in the audience actually cheered when she died !
that tells you why people are seeing this film .
if that 's your only reason , then find a better one , because like a black hole this thing will suck out more of your life than you 'll want .
had i been alone , i would have left 10 minutes into the boring exposition .
this thing is like a moron 's guide to crap film-making : in bred southern git , stupid but attractive leads , knives a plenty , gore a plenty , stock menacing truck , i could go on .
after watching this film , i began to really appreciate jeepers creepers , and i thought that film sucked .
save yourself and avoid this crapfest at every cost .
