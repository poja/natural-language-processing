i went into the movie expecting a little action mixed with a strong story line .
i understand that changes between written works and movies must be made ... for many reasons.the changing of the relationship between the scientists ( they were father - daughter in the book ) the director of cern was eliminated thus causing the scene between the carmelengo and the director to be changed to the carmelengo and the head of the swiss guard in the pope 's office.ron howard made sure to get his dad inserted as a cardinal with a hayseed accent but missed all the symbolism .
both lagdon and the carmelengo ascended to the heavens in the helicopter with hanks character landing in the river and the priest landing upon the chapel in what was described as a christ-like image.at some point this film needs to be remade by a director who is up to the job
