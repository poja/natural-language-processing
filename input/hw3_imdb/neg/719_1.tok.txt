i have read all of shakespeare 's plays , seen productions of a majority of them and even acted in and directed some .
i do not necessarily believe that shakespeare must be done in the `` traditional '' fashion , but i hated this movie.there is nudity that is gratuitous and unnecessary .
there is grotesqueness that is far beyond what i believe shakespeare intended .
some of the dialogue is incomprehensible , and there are those elements , like the singing and dancing that add no meaning to the movie , but replace shakespeare with the director 's self-indulgences.i am sorry to say that i wasted perfectly good money to buy the dvd of this movie .
