when i went to see this film , let 's not say that i had high expectations .
but merely that i had a faint hope that this full length feature would have at least some of the hilarity and wit of tv 's `` da ali g show '' .but as one might expect , this can not translate from a half hour tv show to a 90 minute film .
the movie had no appeal what so ever , and resorted entirely to toilet and juvenile sexual humour .
basicaly , i should have ditched it halfway through but was silly enough to think it might somehow improve by the end , how wrong i was .
i loved the show but hated the movie .
this movie is only for those who find fellatio by canines amusing ...
