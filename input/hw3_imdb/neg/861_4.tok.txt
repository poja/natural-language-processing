sylvester the cat stowaway upon a ship that tweety bird happens to be on with his owner granny .
oh i do n't even have enough words to convey how much i disdain both the tweety and granny characters .
they simply are not funny to me and made this short quite the chore to sit through indeed .
sylvester is a great character on his own , but there 's only so much he can do when confronted by the sheer awfulness of that accursed bid and senile old witch of a granny .
this animated short can be found on disc 4 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 1 and features an optional commentary by micheal barrier.my grade : d+
