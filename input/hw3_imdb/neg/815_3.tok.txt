hard to imagine what they were thinking of when they made this movie ( i.e.
, the writers , directors , producers , actors , editors , etc. )
.
christopher plummer , veteran of 129 movies , frolics along among scores of other actors with apparently no more motivation than to collect a paycheck .
i guess there is nothing wrong with that , but once they are paid that does n't mean anyone has to watch it.it bugs me that there are actually good reviews for this movie here at imdb .
art ?
if you want to see art go to an art gallery , do n't watch this movie .
comedy ?
watch a re-run of the flintstones , about the same plot with less time wasted.dabney coleman gives his usual performance , for better or worse .
and some of the young actors may have gotten some good experience from doing this movie .
but plummer ?
?
?
?
it was embarrassing to watch his performance , in fact i was positively transfixed on him throughout the movie , knowing this was plummer of sound of music fame !
i see from his bio that he called sound of music `` sound of mucus '' , so guess he did n't like it as much as the 100 's of millions who liked him in it.i wonder if today he was asked , how do you rate sound of music compared to where the heart is , what would he say ... .. ?
probably something like `` where the money is '' ... .
