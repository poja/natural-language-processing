c.h.o.m.p.s .
is very much like any number of cheesy late 70s disney family comedys-the cat from outer space or unidentified flying oddball , for instance .
utterly devoid of anything creative , beating the same cliches to death , yet vaguely entertaining in a mindless sort of way .
the actors wo n't win any awards , nor will the director , writer , or fx crew , but in its inoffensive ness and bland predicatability there is some vague entertainment to be had .
the idea of the robot dog as security system is so full of holes you could use it as a colander .
the incredibly repetative disco soundtrack will stick in your head , so beware .
