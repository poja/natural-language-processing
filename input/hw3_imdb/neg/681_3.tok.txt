this documentary is rife with problems.how arrogant is it to make a documentary about your own family ?
i understand you think the subject is interesting .
i was bored with it .
this is n't a fascinating story to me , and i do n't know why you would think it was.i do n't want to come off as mean , but i have to say : most of the people in this film are just not attractive .
and that 's ok , not everyone is pretty .
but your camera technique , to stick the lens in their face so you ca n't help but be overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance because it is filling your 47 '' tv , is not enjoyable .
i had to put my hand up half the time to shield myself from the warts , wrinkles , bags under eyes and yellow teeth .
really , i 'm trying not to sound inhuman , but pull the camera back so its not like total strangers are breathing in my face.the camera work in this `` film '' is rank amateur level .
it 's the kind of camera work you see from everyone with a camcorder at a family picnic .
uninteresting framing , unsteady , even static shots are done carelessly .
put a little effort into it , if you 're going to do this for a living.i honestly ca n't see what the big deal is about this thing .
