`` when a killer calls '' is an unusually nasty slasher flick , with some very unpleasant and unsettling sequences .
the decision was clearly made to try and cash in on the remake of `` when a stranger calls '' by pretty much putting in -- almost word for word -- the phone call sequences from that movie .
they seem very forced.additionally , the filmmaker commits the cardinal ( but all too common ) sin of having the heroine 's friends being repulsive jerks .
so for the beginning of the film , we really like and are rooting for the babysitter ( a nice believable job by rebekah kochan ) , but then she 's joined by standard slasher-flick teenage friends and the mood is ruined.the flick sort of works , but it probably a lot more unpleasant than you 'll be expected , so be fore-warned .
