awip tries to be funny , scary , tense , and romantic ... and fails in every respect .
the acting is average at best , but mostly stupid .
the special effects are not enough to make up for the stupid plot devices , and the chemistry between *any* character is juvenile.if you do n't want to be mad at yourself , do n't pay money to see it .
