witchy hildegard knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted , disgusting ways .
i thought i 'd seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire .
hildy is quite the prankster too : she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shut ... then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire !
`` witchery '' made me sick .
it made my eyes hurt .
i was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever-ever-ever made by otherwise competent people ... until the finale .
i have to admit i loved the ending .
it involves a boy and his toy tape-recorder cornered by linda blair looking fantastically possessed .
the scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie 's over , but you know that old saying : `` if you 've got a great ending , people will forgive you for just about anything ! ''
