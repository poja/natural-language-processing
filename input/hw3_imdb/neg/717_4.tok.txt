despite the fact that the plot follows the well-known recipe of `` who did it '' , which has characterised all the perry mason movies so far , the characters of the present film are not so well-developed and the selected cast fails to give them flesh and blood .
of course , in general , the perry mason movies are not significant , but , even for their low standards , this one is weak .
