i give it a 2 , because of the beautiful mediterranean greece , otherwise it would be 1. when nicholas cage came into with his first lines , i thought he was just kidding .
cage as an italian ?
?
i 'm sorry , but very wrong actor who 's acting is also bad , not to mention his italiano accent .
the story is very loose , it might have been good , but with other actors and obviously with other screenplay .
the camera is great , photography also but why the hell did you cast nicholas cage and penelope cruz for the role .
please do n't get me wrong , i do n't have anything against cage , he has some really great movies , but he obviously is n't for every role .
it 's really a pity that the cast was n't better set , because the story has potential .
