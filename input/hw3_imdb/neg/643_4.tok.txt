after watching this movie on tv , i looked it up in the imdb and imagine to my surprise a user rating of 7.6 !
this is not a good film .
especially bad is the editing ; the poor way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a huge distraction .
it 's not very fluently done .
i do agree that the acting was fairly decent , especially kelly kapowski , and that the story was intriguing enough .
