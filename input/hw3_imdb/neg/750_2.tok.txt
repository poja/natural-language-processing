my first hugely disappointing bbc/jane austen flick .
the tone is off , the costumes are off , the hair is off , the music is from outer space , and robert hardy , bless him , looks like he 's really annoyed to be in such a stinker .
even some of the casting is off .
no , i take that back , a good director can make a silk purse out of a sows ear , so to speak .
the performances in this thing are so over the top and melodramatic that it 's almost a farce of a jane austen story , which is ironic since northanger abbey is a sort of homage/send up of the early gothic novel .
i wanted to slap the female lead after awhile ; who made the decision that she should be such a ninny ?
i had to watch pride & prejudice ( '95 ) immediately to get the bad taste out of my mouth .
phew !
