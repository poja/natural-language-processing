the most accurate description of how billy crystal fairs in `` my giant '' is to say that this movie is to his career as `` ishtar '' was to warren beaty 's - it did n't ruin it , but it slowed it down ... ... .a lot .
crystal should know the three golden rules of hollywood : 1 ) never play opposite a kid 2 ) never play opposite an animal 3 ) never play opposite someone that is almost 3 feet taller than you , is as innocent as a kid and `` acts '' like an animal.what is this story ?
a comedy ?
i guess , but i did n't laugh , except at the scenes where crystal is on his own and not burdened with his ( what-is-her-role-in-this-movie ) ex-wife or the afore-mentioned giant .
did i mention there 's also a kid in this film ?
well , forget about him .
the son is brought in to make us feel sorry for crystal , and we do , but for the actor , not the character .
billy crystal is a funny man .
if you do n't believe me , watch him in old episodes of `` soap '' or `` saturday night live . ''
go rent `` city slicker '' or `` running scared '' or `` when harry met sally .
`` `` giant '' is more ho-hum than fee-fi-fo-fum .
