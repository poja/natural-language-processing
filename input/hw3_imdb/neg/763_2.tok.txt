for a scientifically-engineered super-dog that was supposed to be the answer to petit crime , chomps was a chump.all i ever saw chomps do was sit , or walk , or run .
or run , then walk , then sit ... and then get back up again and stretch , and then walk , and then jog to k-tel dance hits .
and sometimes it had all the answers to the daily jumbo .
but mostly it just sat a lot.all i am saying is : in a celebrity death match , chomps could n't take out mr. bigglesworth .
