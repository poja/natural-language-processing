watching this movie , you just have to ask : what were they thinking ?
there are so many noticeably bad parts of this movie , you might get the feel that its intentionally poor , as some sort of joke.i think the worst part about the film is the directing .
there are so many bad uses of camera angles and other cinematic elements in this movie that are laughably bad .
the funniest example of this would be in the beginning where the party guests are receiving their invitations by email - the same camera angle is used for each shot ( which last an awkward 2 seconds a piece ) and the same computer screen with the same desktop/window/program etc appear .
it even looks like the thing is shot on the same set each time .
the whole sequence was also completely silent , with no music , or sound effects .
overall , it was a poor way to convey the idea that an email was being sent all over town.if you listen closely , you may notice that the music sounds very similar to other movie sound tracks .
this is no surprise- most songs , including the one that opens the movie , are in fact slight alterations of scores from other movies ( see if you can guess which ones ) .
also , i noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra .
it sounds like its been written and played through a low end midi keyboard .
if you are familiar with the lucasarts scum adventure games , the timbre of each instrument sounds like something from the imuse engine.everything else about the movie just plain sucks .
the acting is terrible .
the script is derivative ( ferris beuller ? )
.
there is no joke in the movie remotely funny , unless you see the whole film as one big joke , being played on a paying audience .
do n't rent this .
do n't even watch it when it 's rerun on comedy central .
just forget this - it 's terrible .
