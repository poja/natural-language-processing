a quick , funny coming-of-age matin√©e romp appealing to the underdog aldolescent in us all .
it functions , in effect , as a vehicle for justin long who has subsequently erupted onto our screens in the fourth die hard via pc vs mac ads , dodgeball and the break up .
he 's funny , earnest and young - a big career ahead.a town 's worth of college wannabes find a fake website bartelby ( long ) has set up to delude his judgemental parents and descend on the 'college ' like it were a short notice facebook party .
lewis black summises the anarchic philosophy as a stand-in dean - long 's delinquent friends provide support for the subterfuge and consequent appeal to grander traditions of education and friendship ( adam herschman deserves special mention for his never-flagging slapstick contribution ) .
well executed , feelgood and instantly forgettable .
