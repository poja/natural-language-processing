i like to like movies , but i found nothing to like about the box .
i was interested in the 'hook ' of the plot , but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow .
anyone who states that they understand this movie is probably faking it so that they can feel like they are a part of something , well i have news for them , the emperor has no clothes.the only undertone in this movie is that women are to blame for original sin , and corrupting mankind .
i 've heard that story before , and it makes less and less sense every time .
it 's true that this movie is different than a lot of films currently showing in theatres , but that does n't make it worth the ticket price .
