ok , so one night me and some friends decided to get really stoned and watch a movie .
unfortunately for us , we chose 'ernest goes to africa . '
i have never laughed so hard in my entire life .
this movie is beyond bad .
i have literally pooped out better films than 'ernest goes to africa . '
( i poop films ) the highlight of this movie , for me at least , was the opening sequence , when ernest is making silly faces .
when they showed him with a head the size of a peanut , i lost it .
perhaps i found this so funny because at that point i was the most high .
perhaps you are right.if i had to guess what george w. bush 's favorite movie is , i would guess 'ernest goes to africa . '
never before have i seen a movie rely more on 1950 's stereotypes of people of color .
there were times when words escaped me and i just stared in awe.as i was watching this , i could n't help but wonder , is this movie meant for children ?
do literate adults actually watch this ?
how could there possibly be a whole franchise of 'ernest ' movies ?
is this really my life ?
is this real ?
i hated this movie .
