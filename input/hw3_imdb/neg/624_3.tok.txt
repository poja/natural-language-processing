i ca n't understand why many seem to hate this.this movie ties together many of the overlapping settings of the historical and biblical epics of the fifties , using set pieces , props , and costumes similar to those seen in other movies .
here , however , the story attempts to run through all of human history , with a frame story about the human race being on trial , with a guilty verdict meaning h-bombs will go off all over the world .
the prosecutor is the devil , played with fiendish glee by vincent price .
ok , so it 's a little hokey calling the defender `` the spirit of all men , '' but i think that 's one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm .
the spririt of man is incidentally played quite well by ronald coleman , in his last film .
it is also the last movie in which groucho , harpo , and chico marx all appear , but not together .
groucho plays peiter minuet buying manhattan from the indians , in a scene played purely for campy humor .
chico is n't funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat , and harpo , we are told , is meant to be isaac newton , discovering gravity .
most of the other performances are well done , though.other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space , which is depicted as a region of clouds and blueness .
there is something called `` the great clock of outer space , '' which , when striking midnight , may signal the end of the world.but at its heart , the movie addresses the problems of wmds and the eternal question of whether man is basically good , or basically evil ; and poses it in what i think is an interesting way .
also , anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie .
