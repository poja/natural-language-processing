all those who are into the pc culture are aghast at the dogmatic christian view of this film , claiming it contains racist ideation and/or religious intolerance.those who do n't care about this , but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are dismayed at the lack of such here.those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public , as evidenced in comments here.what is an interesting premise , which is n't original , but is a combination of ghost and from beyond , is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film , yet done with gusto .
what the crew and actors lacked in sensibility , professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they display.it is n't nearly as bad as many here think , and would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense , and it is enough below mediocrity to elicit laughs and groans .
however , it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout , and is close to on par with a corman-produced entry of his earliest period of work , or the material of arkoff or sam katzman .
if you get it for $ 2 ( or less ) as did i , you wo n't feel disappointed , but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made .
