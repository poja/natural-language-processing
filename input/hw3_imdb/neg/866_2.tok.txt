this movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that perrugorria have done .
it looks like a commercial from beginning to end .
the ¨director¨spent the whole time on a tripod , it does n't have pace , rhythm .
it 's illogical .
what a mess .
you can tell what 's gon na happen since the first 15 minutes , and the ending ... wow -- -- -- spoiler -- -- -- -jesus christ , how the hell perrugorria got shot ?
are you serious ?
worst scene of someone getting shot ever !
-- -- -- end of spoiler -- -- -bad directing , bad script , bad acting ... really bad overall .
i would n't recommend this movie at all .
it 's a waste of money and time .
