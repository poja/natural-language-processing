this meandering tale of mob revenge is simply not very interesting , even with ed mcmahon in a ripe role as the chief heavy .
jim brown kicks ass effectively , gloria hendry proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles , and brock peters is decent as the cop who plays by the book .
it 's still dull and badly constructed , and even the print shown on cable is now emasculated of its original james brown score .
