the story starts off in the home of a little girl who is going to have a birthday party and both the mother and father seemed to act rather quiet and reserved with each other .
they proceed to give their daughter her present which is from both of them and it stuck me funny the expressions on the two parents faces as they gave their child this gift , it was almost like , 'i hope she likes it ' !
there is a killing in the film and catherine mary stewart , ( julia kerbridge ) , '' reaper '' ,2000 , gets involved with the case because of family ties .
julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder disrupts her entire life .
rob lowe , ( kevin finney ) , '' view from the top '' ,03 is a next door neighbor in the same apartment dwelling as julia and he eventually goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways .
this is not a bad film , but it is certainly nothing to go crazy about , unless you like a film location in canada and a good looking catherine mary stewart , a native from canada .
