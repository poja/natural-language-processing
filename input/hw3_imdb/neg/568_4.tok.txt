a really funny story idea with good actors but it misses somehow .
the actors are older but none of them looked particularly good .
they needed better make up , photography or something.it is supposed to be a love story and yet the film had more of the rough look of a street film .
i liked the cast but i think the performances were rather bland .
this is where the weakness of the director shows .
perhaps if mrs. spielberg had mr. spielberg directing it would have been a much better film .
