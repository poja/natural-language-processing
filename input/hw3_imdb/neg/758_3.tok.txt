it 's not just that the movie is lame .
it 's more than that .
this movie is just unnecessary .
do we need another western ?
how about a western with afro-americans in the titles roles ?
sound stupid , implausible and a lame attempt at modernizing the genre ?
it is .
incredibly lame and simple minded .
it 's like that lame baz luhrman film `` romeo and juliet '' where he set it in modern times to attract young folks and create some hype with his revamping of a classic tale .
well , baz luhrman failed miserably and so does this mess .
the story is actually not bad however the whole idea of removing the racism out of a racist genre by casting an all afro-american cast is racist in itself .
it 's also puerile and simple minded ( like baz luhrman-man he 's a bad director ) .
hey ( i hear you say ) this was directed by mario van peebles !
he 's also in the film !
how can it be racist ?
it 's not .
i said the idea of casting all afro-americans instead of caucasians was .
the film is n't racist , it 's just pointless , stupid and very very boring .
