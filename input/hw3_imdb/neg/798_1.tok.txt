i know that so many reviews on imdb are extreme , with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or inarticulately tearing it to pieces .
i find neither of these kind of reviews helpful , and so i do not give this film the awful review i am about to , lightly .
the film is art-house science-fiction of the worst kind dressed up as a hollywood blockbuster .
the trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot , but is actually just a tiny part of a wilfully baffling series of events which are never properly resolved .
i like films which challenge the viewer and i do not need to be spoon-fed a plot , and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow .
no - the film is just terrible .
as the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on cameron diaz 's wooden acting and a faltering plot-line .
avoid .
