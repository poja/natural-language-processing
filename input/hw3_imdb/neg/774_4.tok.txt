this could have been better , but it was alright ... it helped me get away from my boredom.i didnt even wan na see it , the only reason i wanted to rent it is because jamie martz is in it..he is a unknown actor but he is shining and is the highlight of the movie ... the ending was so horrible and the acting was good for a b movie ... i give it a 4 out of 10
