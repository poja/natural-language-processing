this movie probably began with a good idea but that 's as far as it went .
when i read the cover at blockbuster i thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie .
the movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions .
there was no explanation of how that would happen but that 's okay i thought it would be developed that in the movie .
it was n't .
in the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads .
beside each one are two attractive women .
the men begin asking `` do you hear that '' or `` do you see them '' .
we conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating .
the women do not see these creatures .
this was fine for the first five minutes but this scene goes on for a full hour .
it is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called `` plot '' of the film .
we are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be middle eastern terrorists .
what is this about ?
we never find out .
the flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why .
at the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do Â– they blow up the lab , but why ?
what is the point ?
we have no idea .
this film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to enumerate but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down !
the makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by cockroaches on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline .
sorry but this movie was a waste of $ 4 and the time i spent driving to the rental store and then watching it .
take my advice .
do n't rent it .
