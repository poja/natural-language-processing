it 's been over 30 years now but i still remember that this movie was the worst i 've ever seen .
i would have thought that in this length of time something worse would have been filmed but i was mistaken .
i just finished watching `` starship troopers '' and it came mighty close but it was still more entertaining than `` poor cow `` .
