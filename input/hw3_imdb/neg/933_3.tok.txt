i was watching the beginning of this on a friday , mid-day , while working at computer at home , relaxing a bit after a hectic week , and cleaning-up some files and answering some communications .
got interrupted a couple of times , so had trouble getting all the details straight ( although it 's hardly a work of hitchcock proportions , where missing a detail can through the whole story off-kilter ) , and besides it was not exactly an `` engrossing '' piece of work.so during a commercial , read the only prior comment here ( by `` mgconlan-1 '' ) , and pretty much can agree with its details.not quite in the category of a film so awful it is fascinatingly `` good , '' but i 'd like to catch on tape when run again ( rather than seeing it as aired ) , so i can fast forward as needed and see the parts which i missed this first time.give it a `` 3* '' because of the attractiveness of the four primary characters .
