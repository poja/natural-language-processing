a box with a button provides a couple with the opportunity to be financially free , but the cost is the life of someone they 've never met .
this is a very tedious film to watch .
richard kelly , who wrote and directed it , decided to make a film without any payoff .
you are taken on a ride of slow build ups , one after the other with minor revelations at best .
at certain moments , i thought to myself , this will have major significance at the end , but nothing does .
the film just leaves one thinking , `` this story could have been told in 30 minutes , without all the stretched out nonsense . ''
i will hope you avoid this god-awful film and maintain your sanity by doing so .
