i am a big fan of sci-fi movies .
so , when i saw this movie in the epg , i thought i was in for a pleasant evening .
what a disappointment !
such a poor display of `` special '' effects i could not imagine in 1980 , but in 2005 ?
come on , why would you do special effects of an helicopter flying in the desert when you can film a real one for a much lower price ( i guess ) ?
and those killer `` muppets '' ... well , i could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage .
you can expect to have a low budget on a movie , but i do n't think it 's reasonable to have a low movie for any budget .
as for the `` star '' of the movie ( i use a lot of quotes tonight ... ) , lou diamond philips , the guy is not even remotely an actor .
maybe he should have stayed to the martial arts movies .
all in all , an awful movie .
maybe i am in a bad mood tonight .
then again , maybe not .
a sincere 1 out of 10 .
