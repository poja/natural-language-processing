renee zellweger is radiant , but the rest of this movie just does not work .
it 's like a hamburger-jello-mold salad -- interesting idea , but who ever thought it would actually work on film ?
i like director labute 's two previous films -- they were mercilessly honest and chillingly funny .
this film manages only to be merciless and chilling -- with jumbo dollops of the cutes .
( as high concept , think : the doris day-rock hudson movie sam peckinpah might have made -- now reduce your expectations to match the present , mass-produced state of hollywood . )
that actors as talented as freeman , kinnear , eckhart , vince , and janney almost make their scenes come alive is a testament to the immensity of their talents to rise above material that just does not cohere .
i would have found freeman 's corny , feel-good-about-yourself speech at the end of the movie funny ( in a lynchean way ) if it were n't for the nagging suspicion that this unconvincingly tacked-on moral is meant to be accepted seriously .
