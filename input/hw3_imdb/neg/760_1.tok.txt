an awful film ; badly written , badly acted , cliched , hackneyed , dross .
the premise is such a good one and a chance to educate about black cowboys but the film is truly dire .
it is a curious mix of a bad 1950 's randolph scott b movie and a bad 1970 's spaghetti western .
the villains are cardboard , the flashbacks laughable , the dialogue excruciating.the deliberate anachronisms ( such as 'victorian ' rap singers and modern swear words like `` motherf****er '' ) , are irritating to the extreme.a frankenstein monster that died on the lab table .
