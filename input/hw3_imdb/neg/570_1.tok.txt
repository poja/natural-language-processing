do n't waste your time .
the plot drags , the characters are wooden and uninteresting , the motivations of their actions are completely indecipherable .
kept waiting for the `` romantic '' or `` comedy '' to occur , and nothing happened .
worse yet , the love letter is n't even romantic , but sounds like it was written by someone desperate to make a deadline .
did i mention that the `` plot twist '' which we saw coming from 15 mins into the movie was `` hollywood clever '' , meaning it is intended to shock , but given the hollywood mentality- does nothing of the sort , and instead is vaguely offensive.it 's not even worth the $ 2 to rent .
do n't bother seeing it .
