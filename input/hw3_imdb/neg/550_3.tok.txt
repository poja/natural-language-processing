the final installment in the karate kid series is predictable , poorly acted , and so bad it borders on the enjoyable .
but not quite , it 's just bad .
in this installment ralph macchio 's karate kid is absent , already having been in one too many of the episodes .
the new kid , played by hillary swank , is the teenage granddaughter of one of mr. miyogi 's wwii buddies .
her parents are recently deceased and her grandmother is unsuccessfully trying to raise this young hellion .
in steps mr. miyogi to set things right .
true to formula , there is a group of neo-fascist bullies , called the alpha troopers that must be put in their place and a new karate move , called the praying mantis .
as i said before this movie is a mess , and should be avoided .
