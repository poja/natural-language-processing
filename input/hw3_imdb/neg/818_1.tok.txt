after seeing this piece of crap you will know why the limeys drive on the left side of the street ... this movie is an absolute no-brainer !
the jokes ( if this is the right word for it ... ) are mostly sub-standard ( about 98 % ) and do miss any punch-line at all .
save the money and get drunk .
you might enjoy this movie being totally wasted , perhaps !
