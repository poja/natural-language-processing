i had high hopes for this film , even though i had not read the book .
richard gere and diane lane together -- should be good already .
but the film does not deliver on the promise .
i kept waiting for more depth to the characters and there was n't .
i have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend for them to fall in love .
that can happen .
but we never really get to know the characters .
i would have liked more focus on them .
the film reminded me in places of bridges of madison county , and that film was far better .
i really felt for the characters in that film , and there was a chemistry ( much more passion ) between clint eastwood and meryl streep that there was n't between gere and lane .
each of them are very good actors in his or her own right .
simply not the right movie for them together .
