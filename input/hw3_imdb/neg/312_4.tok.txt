on halloween a town is terrorized by a lunatic with a big pumpkin for a head .
bad acting compromised mostly of local talent and laughable special effects makes this one baaaaad .
b-movie queen linnea quigley looks embarrassed to be a part of this one and even her considerable charm which has helped so many of her other films ca n't help this one .
pass this cheesy flick if you are looking for a good halloween horror film and rent `` night of the demons '' which also stars ms. quigley .
