it is difficult to rate a writer/director 's first effort .
after all , it is one more movie than i have written or directed .
james hunter wrote a story that was interesting , but suffered from an uneven flow.after all , the idea that a man ( ja rule ) has to choose between the thug life and going straight is common , and even falling in love with the daughter ( tatyana ali ) of the man you killed has been done .
doing it again demands something that is original , and originality is lacking in this film.i was drawn by the inclusion of so many favorites : tia carrere ( trues lies , wayne 's world ) , pam grier ( jackie brown ) , frank langella ( dracula , good night and good luck ) , and ving rhames ( rosewood , dawn of the dead ) .
they did not disappoint in their performances , but they had little to work with.direct to video is becoming more and more common , but that does n't mean it has to be a waste of time .
maybe the sophomore effort of hunter will be more enjoyable .
