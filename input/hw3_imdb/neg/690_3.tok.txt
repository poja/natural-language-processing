although humphrey bogart got star billing in king of the underworld , i 'm willing to bet he did n't thank jack warner for it .
in fact this film was one hollow crown.king of the underworld was supposedly a remake of the paul muni film , dr. socrates , but given humphrey bogart was in the cast , the character is written more like duke mantee in the petrified forest .
he even has an english writer along in the person of james stephenson.kay francis and john eldredge are a pair of married doctors and eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of bogart 's henchmen .
bogey 's a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives eldredge $ 500.00 and there 's more where that came from if he plays his cards right .
eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income .
but when he 's killed in a raid on the gang 's hideout , francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the american medical association no matter how much she protests her innocence .
it 's no good and she and her aunt jessie busley move to a small town to get away from the notoriety.of course the notoriety and bogart and an itinerant leslie howard like writer in stephenson all meet up with her again .
but kay is plucky and resourceful to say the least.bogart 's character was ridiculous , no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts .
he 's a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs .
he 's concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states .
and then let 's kay francis completely outsmart him , hard to believe he was king of anything.definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars .
