to sum this movie up , it is labute carrying his sadism over into the realm of comedic farce .
the predictable result is that he is constantly stepping on all the jokes by insisting on surrounding them with blood-curdling violence and extremely hateful characters .
there is also evidence of his continuing efforts to insult and ridicule everything in sight but then to apologize for it with weak gestures to the pc .
basically the movie just does n't work , its plot is beyond contrived , the characters are one-dimensional cliches , there is no consistency or development of anything , and the comedy ( where it is not totally out of place ) is the worst kind of high concept drivel.morgan freeman and renee zellweger are completely wasted on characters that seem like parodies of studio-driven audience pandering -- no matter what , make them likeable , neutral ( and neutered ) , and full of moral platitudes .
crispin glover is in here just long enough to convince you that he does n't belong in movies anymore .
chris rock actually has negative chemistry with fellow hitman freeman -- it 's as if they are acting in different rooms even when they are two inches away from each other .
in effect , chris rock seems like a digital insert .
at least he is n't as annoying as jar-jar.labute 's 15 minutes may well be up by now .
it 's already looking like he 's overstayed his welcome .
