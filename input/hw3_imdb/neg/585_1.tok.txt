terrible .
the only way i could even begin to consider it funny is if it made fun of itself .
`` amazing .
it 's about an ass that fights crime .
and he drinks/smokes !
how very funny !
it 's funny because where most people put things in their mouth , he puts them in himself !
and now he 's getting sexual service from some lady !
this show is so great ! ''
that is what i would have to say if i liked the show , though i 'm sure you can see the obvious sarcasm .
i 've noticed some people have been comparing this show to 12 oz .
mouse and squid billies .
why would you even try ?
there 's nothing to compare .
the other two shows actually have some decent character development .
in conclusion , i hate assy mcgee .
i twinge at the name of it .
