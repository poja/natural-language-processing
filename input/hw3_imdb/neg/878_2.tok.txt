this is one of the more unromantic movies i have ever seen.casting : richard gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore .
diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself .
supporting cast not too memorable.story : the medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting .
the story is weak - not enough happens to make a movie about .
there is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here .
the setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive .
not destined to be a great one to remember .
