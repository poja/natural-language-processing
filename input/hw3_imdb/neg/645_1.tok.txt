the first thing that struck me about this movie was the terrible acting .
the whole cast was so uniformly inept at delivering their lines that i started laughing at the awful dialog midway through the film .
an even bigger issue with this movie is that at no point do we ever find out what motivates the actions of each character .
the one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is halfdan hussey 's innovative visual effects .
however , as eye-catching as they may be , they do little to make up for the gaping flaws mentioned above .
a dreadful script mixed with community theater level acting does not make for a pleasant viewing .
i was honestly shocked at how bad this movie was .
