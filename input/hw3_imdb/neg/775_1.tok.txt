this is absolutely beyond question the worst movie i have ever seen .
it is so bad in fact that i plan on renting it again as soon as i can find it .
this movie makes 'plan 9 from outer space ' look like an oscar contender .
just looking at the actors makes me want to laugh out loud .
i can not say enough bad things about this movie .
it 's awfulness aproaches perfection.the plot is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in san francisco ( i think ) .
that 's as far as i can go ... i am laughing too hard .
i know it should n't be funny but ... .. *lolololololololol*move over ed wood !
