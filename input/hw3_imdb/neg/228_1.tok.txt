the first few minutes showing the cold and crusty the willis character were pretty enjoyable , especially with jean smart , but it really tanked after that .
this is just hackneyed big man and little irritating kid stuff from way back with no innovation at all .
i know that the casting probably picked this kid to show that willis was just as irritating in his younger self , but i found this kid especially irritating and whinney .
