i watched this movie purely for the setting .
it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of .
the plot was predictable , the acting was mediorcre at best , the scares were all gross-outs , not true scares.i do n't remember much of the plot , and i think that 's because there was n't much of one to remember .
they did n't even use the hotel to it 's fullest potential ... the beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula .
at low tide , you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay , which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks.the best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action ( and i 'm using that term loosly ) scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings !
