in my opinion , the movie was laughable -- bad dialogue .
whoever wrote the script -- please keep your day job .
it 's definitely no godfather or goodfellas .
it 's good to be on the otherside of the table -- poor choice of words .
some of the characters were clowns .
but what do you expect from a low budget movie with no name actors .
