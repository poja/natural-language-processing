unlike the other spaghetti westerns , this one has characters that almost make sense , and can be identified to some degree .
it still has the goofy gunplay of other spaghettis westerns .
a spaghetti , by the way , is another word for a western with no plot , no characters you can care about , and goofy gunplay that does n't make a bit of sense for the era , and relying on great music to make audiences feel something .
this one is more lighthearted , like the ones that bud spencer and terence hill made together .
they , too , were superior to the junk made by eastwood and others , which sado-masochists make their friends watch , if they get a chance .
it looks like everyone had a lot of fun making the movie , too .
it was good to see a giant actor like gilbert roland , who was n't even mentioned on the movie rental box , yet who was clearly the biggest name .
his character was very enjoyable .
there is a three way standoff at the end , which is much superior to the one it spoofs ( the good the bad and the ugly ) , simply because the characters are at least a bit likable and a bit identifiable .
not a good movie , but has a bit of fun to it .
