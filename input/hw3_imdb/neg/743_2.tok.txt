what an awful adaptation .
the worst part was the music .
saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800 's ?

the only character that did n't bore me to sleep was robert hardy .
i had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one , and i love jane austen movies usually .
i did n't even rent it , i borrowed it from the library .
they should have paid me to take it .
i do n't quite understand how catherine and henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another .
isabella and her brother were way overdone ; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the `` bad guys '' and part of the excitement of jane austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good , is n't .
this is probably on my list of the ten worst movies i 've seen .
