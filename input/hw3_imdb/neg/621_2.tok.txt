making a film based on a true story , particularly one as incredible and horrifying as the 1972 andean plane crash , is hard for even the best filmmakers .
but the mexicans behind this forgettable and cheap exploitation flick do n't even try !
the actual names of both the survivors and the casualties of the uruguayan air force plane crash have all been altered , the crash itself is obviously staged in a very slip-shod manner , and the cannibalism aspect has been unnecessarily and gorily played up .
shockingly , it made a ton of money on both sides of the border .
thankfully , thought , it has mercifully been forgotten .
but the same people behind this would later give us the equally revolting guyana : cult of the damned !
this cheap horror exploitation flick necessitated the making of alive some fifteen years later .
that film was a masterpiece .
survive !
, to put it mildly , is not .
