poor jane austen .
this dog of a production does not do her wonderful tongue in cheek novel any justice .
starting at the top ... poorly adapted .
the screenwriter deserves extra low marks for trying to -- come to think of it , i do n't know what she was trying for , but suffice it to say she missed the mark by light years !
!
couple that with all the over-acting and awful production values , this is one adaptation that should never have happened .
it would have been far better if they just gave all the money they poured into this flop and donated it to a worthy charity .
do yourself a favor , read the book .
it is almost certain that you will enjoy it a thousand times more than trying to sit through this excruciating production !
