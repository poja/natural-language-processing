i was n't so impressed with this film , finding it quite tiresome and plain .
the plot line was interesting , a kid creating his own college and enrolling hundreds of kids , but the laughs were few and far between .
the jokes were n't really funny and i did n't bust a gut at any of the scenes .
the characters were n't intriguing and i did n't feel for any of them , even the dawky , fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group .
it was a good first watch , but it did n't blow me away and its not one that i would recommend .
comparing it to other films in the same genre , ie , american pie is just cruel , because there is a film which was laugh-a-plenty .
this accepted failed to raise a smile !
