watching showtime i got the impression that the producers got the idea to put robert deniro and eddie murphy just for the sake of having a film that co-starred the two of them .
other than that i ca n't think of a reason to justify the film 's existence .
not that it is n't amusing in spots , it certainly is , but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted.the thing that really got me was eddie murphy 's character .
i ca n't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job .
when i was working person at new york state crime victims board i had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs , but i ca n't think of one who thought that this was just something i do until i get my career going in an area far afield .
i mean , can you really see eddie murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real police academy , not the screen version , just to get a day job ?
anyway deniro is your basic hard working detective who 's on the trail of a major gun dealer .
he 's undercover and murphy is part of his backup .
so what does the showboating murphy do , he calls a reality based tv series like cops to film the action .
so deniro 's bust gets blown sky high , but the producer of the show gets some good footage of murphy and deniro and decides on a new reality based television series .
so these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working deniro 's case with all the tv cameras around.eddie murphy 's a funny guy , i loved him in beverly hills cop and in the doctor doolittle movies , but he 's done better things than showtime and robert deniro certainly has .
i guess murphy wanted a chance to work with deniro and deniro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film .
