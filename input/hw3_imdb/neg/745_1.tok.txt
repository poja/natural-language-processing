the filmmakers were clearly on drugs .
that 's the only explanation i have .
how else do you explain this travesty of a jane austen adaptation ?
northanger abbey is a parody of a gothic novel .
but this film was made as if it were a gothic novel .
the bizarre music and dream sequences to me suggest drug-induced hallucinations rather than a naive , innocent girl with an overactive imagination , as catherine of the novel is ... the actress who played catherine just stands around bug-eyed all the time .
peter firth looks at least 10 years too old to play henry and he actually seemed a bit on the gay side to me .
i do n't see the attraction between him and catherine .
john thorpe 's portrayal was rather odd but isabella actually was n't that bad .
but nothing could save this piece of crap movie !
one more thing- this film invents a character not in the book , a french friend of general tilney 's , `` the marchioness . ''
why exactly they added her is beyond me .
must have been the drugs .
she is scary-looking beyond belief , with white foundation , red lips and black lines randomly painted on her face ( dimples ? )
.you 'd think this would at least be entertaining in a `` so bad it 's good '' quality but unfortunately , it 's not .
it 's just bad .
