minor plot spoilers ahead !

how did such talented actors get involved in such mindless retreadeddrivel ?
robert deniro plays a dumb hollywood version of the standardviolence prone tough cop ( i.e.
, he beats up the bad guys and rolls hiseyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book ) , and eddie murphy plays anot so tough cop who would rather be an actor ( i.e.
, he screams out , '' freeze , police ! ''
and has his `` tough look '' down pat ) .
naturally , theyare partnered when bobby 's loose cannon tactics get him in hot waterwith the media and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a '' cops '' -like reality show .
take a breath , cuz that 's as funny as itgets.no energy was put into the script - it feels like a pale retread ofevery copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with `` 15 minutes '' starring , yes , deniro himself as , pretty much the character he is playing here .
the jokes fall flat , the action feels listless , and no one seems to behaving a good time .
it 's dead on the screen.please do n't waste your time .
even if you have an overwheming affinityfor one of the actors - avoid it and do them a favor .
becauze if thismakes money , these kinda of scripts will be deeemed perfectly acceptablefor actors of their quality.and to mr. deniro .
you used to make serious films .
i remember them -they were good .
you were nominated for awards for them - remember howmuch fun that was ?
now after `` analyze this '' ( which was good ) , `` meet theparents '' ( which was also good ) , and `` the adventures of rocky andbullwinkle '' ( which was not good ) , i think we need to see you parodyingyourself less , and being yourself more .
`` casino '' feels like a long timeago .
and no , i do n't count `` 15 minutes '' as serious bobby .
anyone whotook that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news
