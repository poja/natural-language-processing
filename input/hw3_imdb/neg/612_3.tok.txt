i have been a fan of the carpenters for a long time , read the biography , watched the specials , and saw the karen carpenter story .
this movie really did n't show the real karen carpenter .
in the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner ( except for one girl friend ) .
the real karen carpenter was much different .
she was outgoing and friendly .
she had lots of friends , especially olive newton-john .
the movie does n't even show karen 's attempts for a solo album and her meeting phil ramone and his wife itchy `` karen '' .
itchy knew the real karen carpenter in new york .
when karen was in new york , she did see a psychologist , but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room .
also , karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid , so she could loss weight , but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too .
also , the karen 's husband in the movie is named bob knight , but in real life was named tom burris .
also , karen was n't divorced from tom , but only separated .
karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died .
also , agnes found karen naked in the closet unciousness , unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white .
the music was very good .
that was the only thing i would recommend on seeing it .
