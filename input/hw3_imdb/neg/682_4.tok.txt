after seeing the movie , i feel the father and the mother are both reasonable person , although not perfect at all .
on the contrary , i do n't like the author , and his two sisters.is a person 's journal an accurate portrait of herself ?
no .
most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem .
so a journal is always a more negative side of a person .
in this movie , the author judge his mother 's life by her journal .
not a wise choice.the author 's elder sister is so ugly , external and internal .
first , she said her father 's second marriage is `` not fair '' for her mother .
then , she said she does n't love her mother .
so , she do n't love both father and mother .
i doubt she love anybody in the world .
her face is so ugly , just a reflection of her heart .
through out the movie , i feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents .
however , i feel the father are mother are very loving to their children , even the author try to portrait them as cold , deceitful person .
