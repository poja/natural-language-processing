talk about being boring !
i got this expecting a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical night on the galactic railroad .
i expected to see crazy stories and hijinks of an eccentric man and to discover his inspirations for such bizarre material .
boy , was i wrong.spring and chaos is mostly boring with only sporadic moments of innovative animation .
it 's certainly nothing to write home about and nowhere near as good as notgr which is something that i suggest you watch instead .
leave this bore alone .
if you absolutely must see then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap .
do not pay top dollar .
