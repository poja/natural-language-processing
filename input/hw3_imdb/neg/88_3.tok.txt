wow , what an overrated movie this turned out to be !
it was supposed to be `` an extremely suspenseful tale of a crazed killer holding a woman hostage and in terror in her home . ''
well , i doubt it terrorized audiences in the early '50s and i know it would put today 's audiences asleep .
`` sends shivers down the spine , '' proclaims the new york times .
no , the only shivers i get is that anyone is left on the planet who believes anything the n.y. times prints about anything.well , it was about a deranged man who held a woman hostage for a short time in her house but the man .
`` howard wilton '' ( robert ryan ) was actually harmless and friendly .
in fact , this was one of the nicest roles ryan ever played !
yes , `` wilton '' was nuts but he never harmed the woman and only wanted a friend to trust.the film even turned boring after awhile with very little going on except a lot of yakking .
beware , my reader ... ..this sucks .
