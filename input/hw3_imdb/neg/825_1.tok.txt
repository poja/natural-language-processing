my god how bad this is .
who is this impostor pretending to be ali g ?
avoid this at all costs .
it replaces the smart multi-layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humour.this was obviously an attempt to get him known in the states before he released his show there on hbo.one commentator here pleads that we not judge the movie on the merits of the show due to the difference in the mediums .
while it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen mr sacha baron cohen could have ensured the smart use of his comic style in a more conventional movie storyline .
instead we have this mess , which in all honesty has nothing at all to do with ali g except for the packaging.terribly disappointing .
go seek out the dvd 's of innit , aiiii , or bling bling for some real ali g .
