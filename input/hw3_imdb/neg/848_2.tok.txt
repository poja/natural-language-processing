1st watched 3/17/2002 - 2 out of 10 ( dir-mario pinzauti ) : silly , sex-filled master & slave having too many intimate relations movie .
this movie seemed to care more about the sex than the story and kind of worked the story around the sex .
laughable dubbing of the original italian language in the version i watched with ridiculous ending where the attempt is made to give an anti-slave statement ( or should i say one line ) .
what a waste of time for everyone who watches this trash .
