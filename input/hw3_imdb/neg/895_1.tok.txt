i know it sounds crazy but yes , i am a huge fan of house party 1 and 2 ( and proud of it !
! )
.
i hated part 3 , and then here comes part 4. i was like are you kidding me with this ?
kid 'n play are nowhere to be found in this movie , and that would 've been okay , had they not foolishly entitled the movie house party 4 , as if it was in any way , shape , form , or fashion related to its predecessors .
every time this movie comes on late at night on usa , i shoot my tv with a rifle .
quite frankly , it really is just that atrocious .
*hurling*as the only remaining fan of kid 'n play that will actually admit to being a fan ( tee hee hee ) , i was appalled .
remember that stupid little boy group immature ?
they snuck their way into house party 3. okay , fine and well but how can part 4 be just about them and nothing else and it also seems like they 're not even the same kids from part 3 .
*confused !

* house party fans : do yourself a favor and stick to house party 1 and 2 and class act .
beyond that , everything else is ridiculous .
