i did my best to watch this two hour fiasco .
it combined the awful special effects and plot of the original `` blob , '' with an execrable boosting of the ( outstanding in the original ) screenplay of `` runaway train . ''
the only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a huge tax deduction and figured they 'd combine it with a shot at hosting a casting couch .
what an incredible stinker !
lou diamond phillips is anxious to show us why he will take any part , no matter how bad .
barry corbin continues his career as a typecast creep , a u.s. senator from texas and plays it well .
he should next do the lead role in the story of trent lott or jesse helms .
the women in this flick all seem to have gotten their roles as consolation prizes in the fay wray memorial screaming contest .
special effects are unbelievably bad .
h.s .
kids in film class in north dakota could have done a better job .
the writers must have pulled a heist at the clich√© bank to accumulate this many .
i could n't watch any more without being forced to sit in the clockwork orange chair .
i have no idea how it ended , except obviously , 119 minutes too late .
ugh !
caveat emptor .
