i was greatly disappointed by the quality of this documentary .
the content is poorly produced , very poor quality video and , especially awful audio .
there 's extremely little about how bruce haack produced his music and virtually no examples of direct connection to later and contemporary electronic music .
the interviews of people who knew bruce haack are ad-hoc mostly inarticulate mumbo-jumbo .
too much yak and not enough haack .
although i have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have a higher than average attention span , even for slow and/or difficult subject matter , i fell asleep while watching this documentary and had to review it to see the parts i slept through .
if you watch this , make sure that you are set up , before viewing , like alex in a clockwork orange .
bruce haack deserves much better than this .
shame on the producer and director .
