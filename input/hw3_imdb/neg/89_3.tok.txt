artificial melodrama with a screenplay adapted by mel dinelli from his play `` the man '' concerns a boarding-house proprietress taking in a troubled handyman who may be homicidal .
despite solid work from ida lupino and robert ryan ( both trying their best ) , this tedious yarn is n't very inventive within its one primary set ( which quickly becomes visually dull ) and underpopulated cast of characters ( there is however a smart pooch who senses the worst ! )
.
hokey and humorless , with a stilted direction from harry horner ( perhaps lupino should have directed ? )
.
where 's all the suspense promised by the ads ?
dinelli also served as a co-producer .
