this was the worst wrestlemania in history .
the only good matches were ricky steamboat vs. hercules hernandez , and the tag title match between the british bulldogs and the dream team ( this one bordered on classic ) .
everything else was either poor or awful .
the idea of having three host cities was unnecessary , confusing and messed up the fluidity of the show .
the celebrity guests were terrible on commentary , especially susan saint james.if you 're interested in the mid 80 's wwf , you 're better renting or buying wrestlemania 3 , or just about any other ppv for that matter .
