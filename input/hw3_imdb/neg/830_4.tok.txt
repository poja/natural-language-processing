even before this film it is clear to see that ali g has become the exact character he set out to parody .
i am not a fan of sacha baron cohen 's character anyway but was curious to see how a man of so little talent was able to convince universal studios to fund a near 1 and a half hour feature film out of a 3 minute joke .
a paper-thin plot is just a torrent of penis and marijuana jokes and i must admit i did cringe when i saw such respected thespians as charles dance and michael gambon stoop so low for employment .
saying that i must admit ( even if i am quite ashamed to ) that i did raise a titter on more than one occasion , and however bad this film was it was never boring , and never once did i consider switching it off ( mainly due to the gorgeous rhona mitra ) .
saying that , only watch this film if you are a teenage lad aged between 14 to 17 and you find dick jokes hilarious .
