if you like to watch movies because they are pretty , you should be okay with this one .
if you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy , then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie , skip it .
at the end of the movie i still did n't know why stargher killed the women the way he did .
when you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from .
in dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also was n't the best , but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained .
they also hinted at a dark background for vaughn 's character but did n't explain , did n't really say why lopez 's child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed , did n't give much of an explanation for the little kid 's problem , etc .
if the rest of the story is compelling , i do n't care about details like how stargher afforded all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers or why the fbi was n't checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killer 's mind thing would work , but i do like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner .
