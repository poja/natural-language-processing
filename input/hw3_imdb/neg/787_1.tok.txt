this is my first review on imdb.com and probably first ever written review of a film i 've done of my own accord - not for some class assignment .
i think that fact alone says something about this movie ... not a good thing !
i am no seasoned journalist or critic ( though i have seen my fair share of movies ) , but i found this particular film so terribly painful to watch , it was necessary for my own peace of mind to vent about the experience .
where better to do it than imdb ?
as i forced myself to sit through the movie , physically writhing from the inability to connect-the-dots , i was sure there would be some `` light at the end of the tunnel '' - a revelation to explain what in samhe.-.ll was going on .
the movie ended and i was as enlightened as dog**** .
after several rewinds to review certain scenes i still could conclude nothing sensible .
i found myself wanting to yell `` does this make sense to anybody ? ''
i would recommend to not waste your time , but then again if i were you i 'd probably want to experience it myself .
if that 's the case , bring a crossword puzzle or something so you do n't get bored .
