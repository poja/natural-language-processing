dumb is right : tom and jerry reach their goal of a non-stop air flight to africa but then worry about mixing in with the natives .
they put on `` blackface , '' crash the plane , try to survive on an airplane wing floating in the ocean , and then survive the wild animals once they get on landhaving read a few reviews before seeing this , i knew what to expect .
it was simply these two guys doing their amos and andy/stepin ' fetchit impressions .
offensive to blacks ?
of course , but that 's the 1930s for you .
some of their lines were funny , some were stupid .
the main fault i had with this cartoon was the audio , as it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were saying.in all , a curiosity piece , but do n't let the racism stop you from checking it out .
at least it gives you an idea of how times have changed ... .for the better .
