as their entire career was a pale impersonation of the beatles , it is no surprise that , shortly after the great fiasco of the beatles `` magical mystery tour , '' the monkees would follow up with their own insipid and creative morass of a movie , called `` head . ''
both movies are not so much a true story with a plot ( though mmt attempted to define a plot ) as they are a hodge-podge of skits and snippets , interspersed with music and songs and out-takes .
`` head '' has no plot , other than the pre-fab-four trying to break free of `` the box '' they are in ( i.e .
the type-casting of being `` monkees '' and the surrounding commercialism ) and yet , always finding themselves back in the box .
most skits involve breaks in the `` fourth wall '' and crossing over into other , seemingly unrelated scenes .
filled with anti-vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to show their other talents , the film bounces around haphazardly- also to be blamed on the multiple directors.the film , like magical mystery tour , is now excused by some fans as `` wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements . ''
phooey .
like mmt , it is too many guys with access to too many drugs all trying to make something artsy and making crap.like mmt , `` head '' has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown monkees songs that are quite decent .
it does develop a bit more charm than mmt and is a bit easier to sit through , but it is not ironic at all that , like everything else the monkees did , this was just a mimicry of something the beatles did first ... even when it comes to laying an egg .
