this is better than the early cronenberg horror films , but nothing more than your basic what-is-real story .
the videogame theme has been told before too .
nothing original is left except the weird cronenberg atmosphere ( which is not that strong here ) with the amusing sexual references and shore 's dark score .
the story never grabs your full attention .
it just flows forward event after event with boring pace .
rating 4/10 .
