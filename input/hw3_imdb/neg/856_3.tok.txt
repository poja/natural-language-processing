okay , now i am pretty sure that my summary got your attention and my commenting that zazu pitts is satan is not without some basis .
let me explain .
the film at first appears to be a dandy b-movie about an evil organization called `` the crooked circle '' and their vow of revenge in the form of murder on a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes .
while this is very odd ( especially the idea of a club of private citizens who solve crimes ) and could have been interesting , this film falls apart despite a rather impressive list of familiar supporting actors .
why ?
well because zazu pitts ( never one of my favorite actresses ) spends most of the movie whining just like olive oyl with a bad toothache !
!
while murders are being committed , people are being kidnapped or whatever , you can always count on zazu whining at full volume -- almost like someone 's obnoxious 3 year-old who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her !
at the same time , she 's not an integral part of the film but received top billing .
why she is even there is beyond me -- i assume it 's just to whine and yell .
as a result , i found the movie practically unwatchable and it was completely ruined .
now you probably know why i referred to this actress of dubious talent as `` satan '' !
i 'm sure that when the actors in this film saw the final product , they , too , felt pretty much the same way i did about her horrible overacting and amateurish performance.this film is in the public domain and can be found for free download on the internet .
i can see why .
