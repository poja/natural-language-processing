this movie stinks majorly .
the only reason i gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming .
it 's total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings .
this is by far the worse anime that came out of japan .
i ca n't believe they actually put their names on this garbage .
what a rip off selling this thing for $ 20 .
if you have n't seen this do n't bother .
if you have , i pity you .
