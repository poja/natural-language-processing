i was under assumption that this was the cat and mouse duo but it was n't instead it was something that should n't have been made not even for its time .
they disguise themselves in the `` blackface '' fashion because they fly to africa and they even act like stepin fetchit and all the others rolled into one .
there are some cartoons that are racist but they are classics , being a mixed woman i have the right to say this , but if you are into the historical aspect of these cartoons try merrie melodies `` coal black and de sebben dwarfs '' or `` angel puss '' you wo n't find them on dvd because the distributors promised not to put them in the mainstream , but you can find them on a site as youtube .
i do n't recommend little kids seeing this but if you want to see how early america was racist and ignorant these are better suggestions , not to mention this particular cartoon has poor animation , i know it was 1932 , but i have seen better for its time .
`` plane '' unnecessary .
