rudolph mat√© 's film from 1950 is given a revamp for the 80 's , dexter cornell ( dennis quaid ) is a university lecturer who used to have a successful writing career , but thats now gone down the tubes along with his marriage .
the initial exposition plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him , so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned , we are not that surprised , unless of course you are familiar with the original .
dexter after being told he has less than 48hrs to live , decides to trace back his steps with the help of one of his students sydney fuller ( meg ryan ) , but they find they have many obstacles in their way.the film begins promisingly in black and white , as dexter staggers in the rain towards the local police station where he wishes to report a murder ... his own , but the huey lewis style 80 's beat that accompanies this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be pretty bad , its only a question of how bad ?
sure enough we are soon using the old flashback medium , but now the film resorts to full technicolor .
there are some brief homages to noir , as the embracing couple stand in front of a venetian blind , but there 's really nothing here to recommend it , the performances are awful , ryan in particular doing her usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine .
the film is a lazy attempt to put some unneeded ooomph into an already fine movie premise , obviously trying to cash in one the body heat audience , the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at a teen audience and to be sure , they are welcome to it .
