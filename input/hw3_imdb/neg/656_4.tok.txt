a wildly uneven film where the major problem is the uneasy mix of comedy and thriller .
to me , the unusual premise is clearly a comedic one , and they should have gone for an all-out comedy .
for example , rock has some funny lines but occasionally he is too unlikable for a comedy .
the scene where betty 's husband gets scalped is too nasty for what should have been a less violent comedy .
an even better example is the hollywood leftist writer preaching to us tritely through freeman 's character , early on , about the plight of the indians ; i mean - yawn !
they should have given freeman something funny to say in that segment , but that is of course much more difficult than to simply write him a boring pc speech.there is yet more new age pc-ness in the form of the ending : the girl not only does n't get the boy - she gets no boy at all ; in fact , the message is that the girl needs no boy at all !
bit of a feminist statement there .
the first half-hour is weak , but the movie gets better - ironically - once zellweger gets to kinnear .
i say `` ironically '' because i 'm not much of a fan of kinnear 's , though he 's solid here .
zellweger is very cute , as usual ; she has the sort of all-american cute looks which should appeal to almost every guy , and i have to wonder why more of such women are n't `` represented '' nowadays , instead of the dogs who inexplicably became stars , such as diaz , roberts , aniston , lopez , or barrymore.since the movie tries to be very serious at times , i have no choice but to criticize freeman 's character which is the gangster 's equivalent of the movie world 's hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold .
there is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between freeman and rock to suggest even remotely that they were father and son .
