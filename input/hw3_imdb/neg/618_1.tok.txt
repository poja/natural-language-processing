lance henriksen has a knack for being the top name in a b-movie , even in this case starring along side charles napier , master control program , and joe don baker .
as always he does a great job of being the bad guy , but the plot is just bad ( do n't even get me started about the ending ) .
and the editing is so horrible it might actually be a thing of beauty .
is it just me , or does it seem that joe don baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute ?
also , anytime glass is broken in this movie , the editing is so anti-phenomenal .
lastly , after watching this , i figure david warner is dying for tron 2.0 to finally get the green light.unfortunately for felony , this will be the third movie i give the rating of 1/10 , joining iron eagle iv and no mercy .
