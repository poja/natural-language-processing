this was not a very good movie , the acting pretty much stunk and the effects were bad most of the time .
but there were some funny moments but most of those were not meant to be funny .
the most hilarious part of the movie to me was the part were a little kid in wheelchair falls out ( thats not the funny part what kind of person do you think i am ) anyway the kid falls out and starts screaming for his big brother , well the brother comes running and the way the kid runs is so funny he 's all stumbling and really over acting i had to rewind it several times so i could laugh some more .
so if your looking for something to rent but just ca n't seem to find anything check this one out and watch for the running part .
