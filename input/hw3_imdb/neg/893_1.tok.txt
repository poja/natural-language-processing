i 've never saw the first three , but i know they 're all better than this ... trash .
it 's about some kid who throws a party .
wow .
sounds amazing ( sarcasm ) .
is it ?
nooo !
it starts off with a kid laying in bed and he 's getting woke up by his mom .
so , the kid pretends to be sick so he does n't have to go to school .
he goes to his uncle 's house and rounds up some people and throws a party .
i did n't laugh at all while watching this trash .
i ca n't imagine someone sitting down and writing down this dialogue thinking `` man , dis !
@ # $ is gunna be big , yo ! ''
makes me wonder if they even had a script for this movie .
i watched this knowing it would be bad , but usually watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of .
this just disgusted me .
two thumbs down !
