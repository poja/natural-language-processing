i got stuck in traffic ( i live in sicily ) on the way to the theater ( at a military base ) to see superman returns , was 15 minutes late , and the only other movie playing was `` see no evil '' , there was no poster up for it , and just a short description of the movie on the schedule ... but my girlfriend and i decided to check it out ... as soon as i saw it was produced by wwe i just knew it was gon na be awful .
the few people in the theater were laughing most of the time , and it was the first movie that i honestly considered walking out on , and i 've seen `` the ringer '' ... okay , i would have walked out of that one , but i was too busy sleeping .
the death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good , but other than that , it was just stupid .
