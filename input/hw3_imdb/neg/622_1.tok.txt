leave ed wood alone .
to call `` plan 9 from outer space '' the worst film ever made would be to deny this abysmally vulgar heap of hollywood guano its rightful title .
this pretentious fusion of witless whimsy and bathetic sociopolitical `` commentary '' actually does seem to be formed along the lines of `` plan 9 , '' with badly-staged scenes of down-on-their-luck actors on cheap sets interspersed with what appears to be footage of battle and crowd scenes cribbed from higher-budget epics .
but whereas `` plan 9 '' occasionally manages to be funny when it means to be and reasonably entertaining overall , this tacky pageant is appallingly lacking in basic showmanship , with scenes ranging from offensively unfunny ( the disgusting burlesque of groucho marx stealing manhattan from the indians ) to low camp ( hedy lamarr attempting to impersonate joan of arc hearing her `` voices '' ) to tedious ( dennis hopper doing absolutely nothing with the role of napoleon ) to the unexpectedly poignant performance of peter lorre as the psychotic nero .
give the worst director trophy to irwin allen , for turning so much into so little .
