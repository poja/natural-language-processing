sigh .
i 'm baffled when i see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot .
i saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards .
it was mildly annoying to see it swiping the grinch who stole christmas heart gag along with the narration , the set design seen many times before , the whole weak tim burton-ish style , and the story that goes nowhere .
and we got the `` joke '' about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time , alright ?
but i guess what 's really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called lenore , the cute little dead girl by roman dirge !
as any quick internet search will reveal .
i mean , what is this ?
this is what they base a hollywood contract on and opens doors in canada for a filmmaker ?
`` give your head a shake '' as don cherry might say .
