i had been avoiding this movie for sometime ... because i viewed it as an unneccesary installment to a series that should have only had 2 parts .
but , after reading some fairly favorable reviews ... from some imdb watchers ... i spent $ 1.50 and rented it at my local video store .
need i go further ... when i say ... .this was a buck-50 lost .
this movie is one of the 10 worst movies i have ever seen .
first off ... .i realize that noone wanted to see a 33 year old macchio in this film ... ..but , why could'nt they have had miyagi read a letter or something from daniel-san ... maybe explaining what happened to daniel ... hell , they could have at least made a quick mention of daniel or something .
but , no ... and to compund the already bad script ... .they added those stupid monks ... i thought monks take a vow of silence ... guess these yapping monks do n't take their vows seriously ... hehehe .
the training the girl went through in the movie was hurried and stupid ... and the paramilitary group of young males ... .were a confusing concept to say the least ... .this was far from even being a martial arts movie ... with the girl only fighting briefly in the final scene ... .and then she did n't even come close to getting hit even once ... by the male fighting her ... .give me a break ... she would have gotten hit at least once ... .i guess the writers and directors thought it would be to shocking to see a girl get punched by a male in this one .
i could go on and on ... but , basically ... i 'll end by saying that this movie was just so bad ... .even the girl they chose was n't nice to even look at ( she was sorta `` butch '' looking ) ... .i can only think of a handful of movies that i have sit through ... that compare to just how bad this flick was ... ..don '' t waste your time on this one ... ... ... .
