i ca n't help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom .
it 's like they did n't even bothered trying ro write good comedy , just rehash third rate jokes and hope it sticks .
the worst of all this is that it 's all so damm uninteresting and lacking in every way.to make things worse leading man kevin james has a permanent `` i 'm so funny '' smug grin on his face that would be tolerable if only he once delivered in the comedy department , which he does n't , he just lies there doing nothing like a big unfunny baby .
which takes me to the relationship between the heffernan's- easily the most insincere and poor representation of a married couple on any tv show , really headache inducingly obnoxious remini spends the whole show as if it where a violent chore to even be around her own husband .
jerry stiller yanking the few laughs on the show is doing a 100 % repetition of his role as frank costanza in seinfeld only this time his hints mostly tread on water due to the inability of the central duo in recognizing a joke even if it flew by them .
the episodes just drift along in a stream of nothingness , their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worse.this is not even a waste of talent , there is no talent here , this is a laughless creative desert .
