this movie would have been alright , indeed probably excellent , if the directors would have left the interviews and the concert footage separate .
`` into the void '' is a great song , and i hate how it is cut off at the best part to go to an mumbling interview with ozzy osbourne .
that should have been at the end of the film , or located in a special feature .
the best part of concert dvds is to put them on and let the music play , but `` black sabbath : the last supper '' is hard to put and and simply let play because the music is continually interrupted .
nevertheless , there are a few strengths to this film ; the concert footage , when it does play , it excellent .
black sabbath returns to the stage after a long hiatus without osbourne and this film captures that well : sabbath basically rocks the fans .
the fans , of course , have a sweet advantage in the film because they are seeing the band live , of course , but also they do not have to put up with the incessant interviews that the dvd viewers are burdened with .
shame on jeb brien and monica hardiman ( the directors ) for doing this to the film !
also , shame on wyatt smith for editing the film in such a way .
