this is supposed to be based on wilkie collins ' _the_woman_in_white_ , but the only resemblance it bore to that story were the characters ' names , the time period , and the settings .
if they were going to change the story so thoroughly , i do n't understand why they needed to keep up the pretense that it came from wilkie collins .
go read the book .
it 's much better .
