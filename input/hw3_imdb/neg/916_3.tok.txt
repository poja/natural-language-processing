why did i buy this movie on dvd ?
, well the short answer would be : i really do n't know .
as for the longer version , it pretty much comes down to the fact that i genuinely like tatyana ali and she plays alicia in this.now does tatyana ali give a genuinely good effort in this movie ?
i must say that it is one of the better , and she is shaping up to be a rather decent actress .
i am very much looking forward to see her in action , when better material will be available.this being said , this movie was terrible - and my score is given based on this : 1 star for not being the worst movie i 've seen , 1 star for the performance of tatyana ali , and 1 star for not thinking that it only deserves 2 stars , there are worse movies for that.ja rule should stick to rapping , not my favourite rapper to say the least , but some seem to like him - and if he is contained there , i would be delighted not to see him contaminate the acting scene.ving rhames : ah man , marcellus wallace what are you doing here - you used to be cool man .
just because michael caine is a fiercely brilliant actor , who has been in so many terrible flicks as well as good , you do n't have to copy him ving.the rest of the semi big names in the cast : it 's ok , there are bills to be paid , and we all have to do things we 're not proud of time to time.the movie itself .
it so massively flawed , it 's pretty difficult to know where to start .
it 's more like a bunch of scenes thrown in together , as were the director to say `` we need to tell this , and we need to tell that '' .
there is a story , unfortunately there is nothing surprising about or within it .
to say the least , the plot changes in the story were overly obvious and it was therefore predictable what was going to happen all the time.to sum up in one word : reallynotgood
