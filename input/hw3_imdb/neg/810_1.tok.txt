if i could give this movie a negative rating i would .
the humor is the cruelest i have ever seen in a film .
horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
there are 2 plots , neither of which supports half of a film .
where is the `` depth '' others see in this movie ?
that no good deed goes unpunished ?
that only the heartless can succeed ?
the film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done .
the acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrifying .
if you think that the 3 stooges are too nice to each other , if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a bowie knife is a real thigh slapper , if you thought `` schindler 's list '' was hilarious , then this movie is for you .
