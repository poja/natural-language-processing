lou costello ( sans abbott ) plays a small town self-employed `` rubbish collector '' ( and the inventor of a time-controlling machine ! )
who is secretly courting the niece of the town big-shot .
after a spat , lou 's girl ( dorothy provine ) runs into a misty cave -- why it 's misty we never learn -- and emerges as a 30 foot giant .
provine is certainly a good sport , and she does n't bother trying not to look ridiculous ( it would 've been impossible anyway ) , yet the screenwriter is really cruel to this character , turning her not only into a giant but a nagging harpy as well .
provine bosses costello around while creating havoc with the army troops who get called in , but nothing funny is done with the transformation .
trumped by `` attack of the 50 ft. woman '' the previous year , the film does feature lou costello in his final bow , but provides little else .
the special effects are marginal , while the script needed funnier lines and the direction snappier pacing .
