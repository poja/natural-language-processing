i classify this as the worst movie of all time.if there ever was a movie i would wish upon my enemies , this would be it .
the plot is ridiculous , there are only 2 characters , and the coincidences between these characters just completely strain belief.these factors combined to make this an extremely boring movie.my wife and mother walked out on the movie about 15 minutes in .
i figured that a movie this boring and slow *must* have some cool interesting plot twist , and a was quite disappointed when nothing exciting materialized.i briefly considered sending the filmmakers a bill for my 2 hours of lost life .
