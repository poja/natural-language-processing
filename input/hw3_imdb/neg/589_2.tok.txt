i will never get back the three hours of life this film has stolen from me.the film is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process .
i 'd love to know what they were on when this film was being made.its also the most historically-inaccurate film in existence ; 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or predictions taking place.characters are unlikeable , design is simplistic and everything just rambles on without any sense or logic to it.and the ending is probably the worst of it : its supposed to be thought-provoking but the only thought that entered my mind is `` what the f $ *k is going on ?
! ''
i 'd say for anyone looking for serious entertainment purposes , avoid this film at all cost and choose a sci-fi movie that is n't stuck up its own @ $ $ .
