do n't see this movie !
it 's ... repulsive !
the start is indeed very good , but in the middle everything falls and i really regret spending 80 crowns ( about 11 dollars ) on the ticket !
peter dalle should consider this as his last chance to gain peoples interest .
awful picture !
the only bright spot is the splendid work of robert gustavsson , lena nyman and g√∂sta ekman.hope you take my advise ... the picture is rubbish .
