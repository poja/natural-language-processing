the cheesiest movie i 've ever seen , not scary , just bad .
1st movie made by the wwe , and trust me , the only person this movie might appeal to is wrestling fans .
it has terrible acting and the worst directing i 've seen yet.i found myself laughing at the storyline , and bad actors .
i saw that the wwe people tried really hard to put a lot of the wrestling moves in the kills , and several camera effects .
i think they copied a lot from silent hill .
this movie 's not engaging either , so if you do see it , you 're gon na find yourself tuning out because of it 's lack of suspense .
the ending 's the worst , no matter what , you 'll come out wanting your money back
