never ever take a film just for its good looking title.although it all starts well , the film suffers the same imperfections you see in b-films .
its like at a certain moment the writer does not any more how to end the film , so he ends it in a way nobody suspects it thinking this way he is ingenious.a film to be listed on top of the garbage list .
