we really do n't know where to begin when talking about this movie .
but we 'll start with the plot .
we sincerely suspect that whomever wrote/produced/directed this movie never read the book .
because they missed the entire point .
satirical , not horror .
just a hint .
second , the bath scene .
enough said .
third , the added characters .
the sketchy gothic french lady and her black page who enjoys holding hands and cartwheeling .
we do n't understand where this came from either .
and then there was the casting .
all of them were really unlikeable .
we were very upset that catherine and mr. tilney ended up together , because they were so unlikable that no one would ever wish to see them happy .
and ... the music .
we think that the bbc producers ran out of money , so raided their grandmother 's attic .
and they found some old records .
saxophone , wailing female voices , and an occasional electric guitar .
*shudder*plus , the best line ever : `` since you left , the white rose bush has died of grief . ''
if anybody has any explanation , we would love to hear it .
because it makes absolutely no sense.we are still wondering what on earth everyone involved was thinking when they cruelly released this pathetic excuse of a movie out on the public .
we think it should be considered a federal offense .
torture is illegal.this movie is by far the worst we have seen to date .
and i 've seen a lot of movies.our recommendation : give this movie to whomever you hate .
they will watch it , and want to kill themselves .
and we agree with a previous post , we would give this 0 stars , if at all possible .
do not watch !
!
and we strongly suspect that everyone who commented so far in favor of this movie were involved in its production .
or were mentally insane .
these are the only reasons we have been able to come up with that would instigate giving a favorable review .
