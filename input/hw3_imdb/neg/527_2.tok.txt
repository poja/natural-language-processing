this movie moved much too slowly for my taste.the concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally-retarded family member in a way that i have not previously seen on-screen.however , the execution of the concept was flawed.each character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearance , then one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the way.that is , each character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the movie , which i found to be a form of emotional and social retardation.i suppose this has artistic merit , given the irony that the story centers around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above-average intelligence friends and family.the acting , however , was well-done without exception.i agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful.in summary , i think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematography , but fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described .
