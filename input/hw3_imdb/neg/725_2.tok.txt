it 's been mentioned by others the inane dialogue in this series and i agree.if mom and daughter were really that sharp-witted they should be queen and princess of the universe , not kicking around in some little town.i 've really tried to watch a few episodes but when the witty staccato mumbling pop culture drivel starts i flip the channel.i watched a bit of a new episode to see if anything had changed ( for the better i 'd hoped ) but nope , same old `` we 're so clever with our references to pop culture '' that i nearly barfed.long time fans who are n't happy with the newer seasons might just be wising up and getting sick of the regurgitated pablum that never stops .
