generally speaking i do n't make negative comments on here .
but since this is a festival piece , i do n't want you to waste your time when you could see something else that might not be playing again.i thought the actors were pretty bad .
for instance , they totally did n't play off each other , rather , they waited to recite their lines which were pretty poor to begin with .
the dialogue sounded really forced .
norman or whatever his name tried , or so it would appear , to be witty and biting in the lines he chose but just fell really short.after words he asked if anyone saw the ending coming and some people were all `` yea '' , and he all but called them liars .
look there were so many clues , the biggest being a briefcase full of cash for a $ 500 an hour whore .
i mean the john gave her at least 20g 's ... tell tale sign .
now no you could n't see exactly what was going to happen but by the time the twist actually occurred , i for one , did n't even care .
i was just glad to get out of there .
i asked him which draft he shot and he said 8.1 , maybe next time he will wait to shoot 'til 15.3 cause this needed a lot of work.but he seemed like a fairly nice guy , he is making his own films , he 'll probably get better and i hope he does , not in a snotty way either , i mean it , i wish him luck .
just remember , this is just my opinion .
