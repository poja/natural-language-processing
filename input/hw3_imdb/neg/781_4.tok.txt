this is a flic that you can safely avoid .
childish plot and poor acting from cameron ( she really should n't take on these serious roles - they do n't suit her ) besides she looks most unglamorous , lets face it , shes ' great in charlies angels and she was superb in there 's something about mary ... the pope would n't be a good president of the usa and vice versa , my point being that there are some actors/actresses who are suited to a particular type of character and cameron is most unsuited for this serious housewife type - there are a dozen other actress ' would have done a far better job .
the movie itself is rather unbelievable and juvenile in its plot ( did i spell juvinile right ?
? )
i noticed a comment from another reviewer who has given the box a 10 rating , who was derisive in his comments on other reviewers who gave the movie a 1 or 2 rating and could n't spell .
i mean whats spelling got to do with a movie review ?
does he mean that persons who spell perfectly could appreciate this movie more that the ones who could n't ?
c'mon 'professor .
