i 've seen some terrible book-to-film adaptations in my day , but this one tops them all !
the bizarrely unattractive cast detracts from the story , which is , in itself , untrue to the book .
mr. tilney is nothing like handsome ; as for catherine morland , a rat-like appearance makes this heroine a difficult one to sell to a sympathetic audience .
isabella is nothing like the aphrodite one reads about in the original text , and james morland appears in the film far too little to leave the viewer with any understanding of his important role in the story .
also , as others have pointed out before , this novel was intended to satirize the gothic craze prevalent in austen 's time , but it appears that this `` soft horror '' film was designed and meant to be taken seriously .
i 'm sure jane austen turns over in her grave each time one of her fans is disappointed by this awful interpretation of what was supposed to be a joke .
