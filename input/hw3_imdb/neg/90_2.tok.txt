the only reason this movie is not given a 1 ( awful ) vote is that the acting of both ida lupino and robert ryan is superb .
ida lupino who is lovely , as usual , becomes increasingly distraught as she tries various means to rid herself of a madman .
robert ryan is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character , guided only by his disturbed mind , changes from one minute to the next .
seemingly simple and docile , suddenly he becomes clever and threatening .
ms. lupino 's character was in more danger from that house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who came along .
she could not manage to get out of her of her own house : windows did n't open , both front and back doors locked and unlocked from the inside with a key .
you could not have designed a worse fire-trap if you tried .
she did not take the precaution of having even one extra key .
nor could she figure out how to summon help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked in and out of sight of her captor .
i do n't know what war her husband was killed in , but if it was world war ii , the furnishings in her house , the styles of the clothes , especially the children and the telephone company repairman 's car are clearly anachronistic .
i recommend watching this movie just to see what oddities you can find .
