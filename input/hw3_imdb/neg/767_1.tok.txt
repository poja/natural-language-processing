while credited as a tom and jerry cartoon , this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier mutt-and-jeff rip-off featuring them going to africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in .
while the dialect humor is mostly lame , there is a brief musical sequence involving `` black skeletons '' that was entertaining .
i have to ask however , how could tom and jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times ?
one of many entries produced by the van beuren corporation for distribution by rko radio pictures before rko made a deal with disney .
only worth seeing if you 're an animation buff or is interested in how certain ethnicities were stereotyped as entertainment way back when .
