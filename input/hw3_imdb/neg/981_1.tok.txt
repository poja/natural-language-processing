i was an extra on this film , in the part shot at the airport in the first 15 minutes or so ; i was one of the fleeing ( mostly mexican ) bangladeshi refugees running across the runways at ryan field in tucson .
at one point , standing around in our turbans as we waited for another shot , one of my fellow extras turned to me asked me what the move was going to be about .
i told him it was going to be a remake of lost horizons , only as a musical .
there was a long pause , then he replied : `` man , this movie is gon na suck '' .
pretty perceptive of him , i thought .
i had a good time and made a bit of money , but even with some interesting personal memories attached to this movie i ca n't sit through the whole thing .
if you ever saw the movie `` the swarm '' , you can pretty much get the idea .
you get to see a lot of famous and talented people wasted on an an idea that on the face of it is just bad .
the idea seemed to be that if you throw enough money at a movie and hire enough big names , then a good story and good writing are n't necessary .
just turn the big crank , and out comes the product .
it 's just not worth watching .
