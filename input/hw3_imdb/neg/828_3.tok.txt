may contain spoilers for about the last four years i 've been a keen fan of ali g. sacha baron cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and , in my view , his best creation is borat who 's as funny as hell and quite shameless in what he does and says to people.anyway , to the movie .
i did n't bother paying money to see this in the cinema ; i suppose because i did n't expect a lot but when i hired the dvd recently , i found the whole thing pretty sad .
the best part of ali 's taking the mickey out of others was largely missing and the script an plot was pretty damned awful ; hooking all the car batteries together to blow a safe - really !

this movie goes to show i think that some things can run for too long and definitely do n't translate to the big screen .
the movie also had that syrupy sweet ending that i 've come to expect from british films .
where have all the good british movie making ideals gone to ?
that said , there were the odd very funny moments such as the dog in ali 's bed and ali 's audience with hm the q with the `` shaven haven - respect '' remark.so , in summary , i am an ali g and borat fan and i have enjoyed many of his interviews ( notably the one with anita roddick of the body shop ) but this movie fell really flat with me .
if there 's to be another movie , i hope it 's a whole lot better than this lot of old tripe.weasel100 canberra , australia
