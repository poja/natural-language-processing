ok , yes i know i 'm a philistine , and i have no knowledge of , nor love for opera .
i readily admit that i might feel differently about this film if i did .
but i do n't .
so , for those of you like me , skip this one unless you want to look at the pretty ( sometimes unclothed ) girls .
for what it 's worth , i thought the first segment with theresa russell ( who i did n't recognize ) was the best of the lot .
