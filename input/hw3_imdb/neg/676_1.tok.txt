tyra banks needs to teach these girls that it 's not all about being beautiful on the outside .
the inside counts for something too .
a lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls .
i see tyra less involved with the girls in every season .
about the only thing worth watching top model for is mr. jay manuel .
recently , tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual .
i felt that she should have done more to encourage her .
it was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look .
tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident trannie ms. jay to help the girl out .
instead , the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism .
it 's a shame because i truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons .
there 's a reason why project runway has all 4 seasons out on dvd and top model only has 1 season on dvd .
it 's called taste .
top model seriously needs a lot of revamping an some more humanity .
