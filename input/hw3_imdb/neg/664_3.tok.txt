another movie with a star of a wrestling .
so far i have noticed ... .wrestlers ca n't act on the movie screen .
this movie is no exception.the action is dreadful .
it makes you laugh at what they say , and they ca n't be serious , they try to act scared but they fail and look stupid .
the acting is horrible , possibly from the bad director.the plot was stupid ... .just some people get placed in a hotel because they 're criminals , and they get randomly killed off .
the movie is stupid all the way through , making it one of the worst i have ever seen.the only think and this is why i give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way jacob goodnight dies .
the pole through the head and the stories of him plunging was awesome.overall this is a really horrible movie , and you definitely should n't waste your time with it .
