first of all .
should cameron diaz ever be allowed to act again ?
to call that a bad performance would be an insult to bad performances .
that was a historically horrific performance .
any small chance that diaz had at being a serious actress is now completely done after that .
laughably horrible.two , the movie was extremely boring , and not very thought provoking at all .
i can sit around and ponder human nature without having to watch terrible actors , play out a terrible story.third , there was not a single likable character , and even worse , it seemed like that was done by design .
you were not supposed to like , or feel sympathy for any character .
it was quite effective .
i wanted them all to just die to be honest .
aliens included .
kid included .
everyone was just one big mope in this movie .
everyone literally just moped around , and they called it a movie .
you could barely distinguish the zombie `` employees , '' with regular people , because they all seemed like zombies.lastly , nothing really makes sense .
from the characters reactions and emotions , to the literal story line , it all just seems random .
this is just a really bad movie , disguised and couched as a `` thinking mans movie , '' which is meant to be confusing .
give me a break .
a bad movie is a bad movie .
and this movie was bad .
