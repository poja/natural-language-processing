this movie was difficult for me to watch .
stan looked very old and ill compared to what i remembered , and ollie was heavier than i ever recall in another film .
most difficult though were gaps in the script/production where i found myself wondering , `` how did they get from here to there ?
?
? ''
it took nearly half the film before i could deal with the dubbing of non-american actors -- that was also a distraction.although i miss great actors such as laurel and hardy -- will there ever be great actors like those of the old studio era ?
?
?
-- this film helps me understand why actors sometimes `` bow out '' in their prime .
