i saw house party 1-3 and i loved them but this one was n't funny at all.first it ca n't be a house party movie without kid n'play right ?
this one sucks and it was more like a black version of ferris bueller 's day off than a house party movie.second who the heck is john-john ?
these new character 's ca n't even compare to the ones from the other three movies.now i know why they put it straight to video.it has horrible music , weak plot , untalented actors , and no hilarious jokes at all.my advice , watch this movie at night only if you ca n't get to sleep.they should have ended the series after house party 3 since kid'n'play separated after that one.i hate this one am glad my local video store does n't have this film and never want to buy it or want to see it on comedy central either.just because chris strokes has talent managing an up-and-coming r & b group does n't mean he has talent directing and producing films am i right or what ?
finally , the female characters were all dressed up like cheap two-dollar hookers throughout most of the flick.imx separated a year after this flick got released probably due to the failure of this film and are all but forgotten nowadays .
in simplier terms this movie just plain old sucks !
