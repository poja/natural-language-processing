oddly , i have very little to say about `` the box '' so this will be pretty brief .
i have never read the richard matheson novella `` button , button '' from which the film is based , but considering what i saw in this `` adaptation '' , there could n't have been much semblance to such a legendary author 's work .
`` the box '' is about a family who discover a strange contraption on their doorstep that has a button on it .
frank langella shows up and explains how they will be given one million dollars if they push the button - the only 'catch ' is that it will automatically kill someone , somewhere ... ?
?
spoiler ?
?
they push it ?
?
end of spoilers ?
?
that whole concept was interesting on its own , but somehow they managed to extend the movie into some convoluted stargate knock-off that pads it out until a pretty decent ending with a pretty profound message .
while i 'm trying to be as 'fair ' as possible , i still must say that this was not my cup of tea and it bored me severely .
i guess its from the same director as `` donnie darko '' which i remember liking when i saw it years ago .
`` the box '' would 've worked well as a short film , but since it was so lifelessly adapted this way , i ca n't come close to recommending it ...
