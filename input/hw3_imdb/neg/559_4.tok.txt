i thought this movie was going to be a disgrace to the series .
after all , part 3 did n't measure up to part 2 , and this one does n't have daniel sawn .
miyagi 's humour was n't quite as witty in this one as in part 3 , but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watching.the girl 's part was pretty good .
she 's a lost teenager who needs direction .
i find the plot a little hard to believe .
that the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of mr. miyagi , a man she just met .
of course , he was a friend of her brother.i did appreciate the monastery .
one might think from some of my other reviews that i would n't have liked the dancing monks , but i thought it was amusing .
it showed that they know how to have some fun .
now if these were monks in ancient china dancing to pop-music , that would have been another matter.probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks would n't kill a bug .
miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid , nations trying to destroy each other is stupid , but having respect for all life is not stupid .
miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well.i give this movie a 4 out of 10. sure , there were some things i liked about it .
it was n't as funny as part three , and no character could ever live up to sato in part 2. this movie has no re-watch value .
i ca n't imagine watching it again , but it is worth seeing once .
