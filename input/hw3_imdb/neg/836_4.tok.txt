undoubtedly , the least among the spaghetti westerns i 've been watching lately : basically a low-brow rip-off of leone 's the good , the bad and the ugly ( 1966 ) with three disparate characters outwitting one another ( and occasionally forming shaky alliances ) in their search for hidden gold .
leonard maltin rated it a bomb ; while it 's harmless enough , it 's also totally routine and , fatally , the three main roles are stereotypes , that is to say , uninteresting : eddie byrnes is a bank employee with ideas regarding his consignment being transported by train ; gilbert roland is the `` legendary '' but ageing mexican bandit ( his frequent lapses into spanish when excited are quite corny ! )
who , apparently , is still irresistible to women ; george hilton as an enigmatic bounty hunter tries too hard to emulate clint eastwood 's man with no name figure .
director castellari - whom i saw at the italian b-movie retrospective held during the 2004 venice film festival , where he came off as the most pompous of the cult movie directors present !
- shows little genuine feeling for the western ( on the strength of two above-average franco nero efforts in the genre , i ordered his collaboration with castellari keoma [ 1976 ] ... i 'm keeping my fingers crossed now ! )
and the film 's tongue-in-cheek approach is equally lamentable .
