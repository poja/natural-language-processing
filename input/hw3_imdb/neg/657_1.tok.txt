by the standards of hollywood this movie was filmed and edited as hollywood movies are and therefore looked like a movie you would get out of a big-time production studio within hollywood .
thats where anything remotely close to having hollywood standards ends .
this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life !
i am not joking .
the story was so unbelievably stupid and unrealistic that i could not contain my laughter in the movie theater through the course of watching this film .
i know what you 're saying , `` its a horror film its not supposed to have a good story it 's supposed to scare you . ''
well let me tell you something , the movie is not even scary in the least bit .
its too full of stupid bits that cancels out the little suspense there may have been .
the acting was awful as well , along with the scariness of the murderer , who you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage jacking off .
throughout the movie i kept getting a sense i was watching something that was thought up , written , produced , and directed by a high-schooler who watches too much pornography .
please , do n't see this movie , spend your $ 8.50 on other things , like a snow cone , which would be much more worth your while .
