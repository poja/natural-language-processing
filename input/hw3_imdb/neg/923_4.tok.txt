as a recent convert to curb your enthusiasm , which prompted my viewing of all season 's episodes , i expected more , much more from jeff 's efforts.when i view a film offering a slice of an average 'joe 's ' life i need reasons to be interested , to care , to feel and believe .
and with jeff garlin at the helm i also expected a bevy of shining comedic moments .
this film failed me time and again.jeff plays a living with mom , plump sad sack who is a social disaster .
he has not had a relationships , real or even casual , for many years .
he appears to be mostly unemployed and , as noted , shacks with his mommy dearest .
can things get worse ?
sure .
in short order he gets sacked by everyone around him including silverman , second city ( his comedy workshop ) and his agent .
all reinforce his 'loser ' status .
silverman 's 'fatty ' experiment was as cruel as it was absurd .
his obsession with the role of `` marty , '' as the means of his career 's salvation , also hits a big dead end.while the film 's final moments offer a glimpse of better things to come the cinematic 'journey , ' albeit with occasional golden glimmers , was sadly lacking .
