the man with bogart 's face sets it self up to mine the viewers nostalgia for the late 30's-late 40 's film era .
it fails miserably for several reasons .
first , sacchi , while looking reasonably like bogart and even speaking like him on occassion and using his mannerisms , completely lacks any of bogart 's charisma or acting ability .
this is really apparent whenever sacchi is not clearly imitating a scene from one of bogart 's films .
second , the film does not have the first rate character actors bogart was able to work with .
there are no peter lorre 's or sydney greenstreet 's in this one , folks .
sure we are treated to performances by victor buaeno , olivia hussey and george raft amongst others , but they just are n't of the same caliber ( or are n't given enough screen time or are miscast ) .
third , the attempts at `` modern '' humor all fall through .
all of the underwear jokes , having marlowe almost *never* remove that damn hat and trench coat ( even though bogart would have ) , etc .
just are n't funny and really pull down this film .
fourth , i 've never heard a goofier theme song this side of mitchell .
finally , the film 's false reverence for bogart ( and other classic actors work ) is truly irritating .
bogart almost *never* played a straight hero , on those occasions he was a hero .
he played complicated characters .
this movie makes bogart out to be a trigger-happy , moralistic do-gooder .
while this may have been true about some film characters , bogart 's characters rarely fit that bill .
it 's movies like this that make people unexposed to the cinema of the past think that all of it is hokey , `` good guy beats the bad guys and gets the girl '' crap with low production values .
