l'auberge espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any episode of dobie gillis .
where is their bob denver ?
do they even have a dwayne hickman ?
a french man moves to barcelona to attend classes .
he moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than himself , and they do and say uninteresting things .
this movie is unbelievably bland .
the only bright spot was a pretty french girl who played a belgian lesbian .
she places her hands behind her head and reveals shaven underarms , not the usual tufts of dark , smelly hair .
but bare armpits does not a good movie make .
l'emmerdeur was funny , so was la cage aux folles .
l'auberge espagnole and le placard makes you wonder what is going wrong with french comedy .
