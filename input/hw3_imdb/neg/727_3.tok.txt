when i first watch this series , the impression i got was that the characters were charming and funny , lorelai and rory in particular were witty and intelligent conversationalist albeit a bit too talkative .
after watching it for some time , however , my opinion changed.the main characters slowly revealed themselves to be self-centered self-obsessed narcissists , who treated tiny wounds to their pride as the worst insults in their existence .
for example , rory would n't speak to her mother for months when lorelai did n't consult her on her impulsive marriage , while lorelai dumped luke for simply wanting a little time to adjust to his new life circumstances .
these people are shallow , see themselves as the center of the universe where everyone else should behave exactly according to how their own rigid rules , and if they do n't , they will hold grudges against them for an eternity .
they do n't want to see other people 's problems and treat the smallest slight as the gravest offence .
most of the characters appear to lack the ability to behave in a grown-up way .
they think they should do whatever that they wanted and everyone else be damned.the series is character-based , so when the main characters became so unlikeable the show also became impossible to watch .
i still have the rest of the series , but i doubt if i will ever finish watching them .
i will also hold anyone who think highly of the show and its awful characters with the greatest suspicion - they must just as horrid as lorelai et al .
