i ca n't believe the high marks people have given this film on this site .
the writing is incredibly bad with people coming in at just the right time and revealing exactly what the heroine is doing to try to escape .
( do n't you just hate it when that happens ? )
.
and the acting is so very , very bad that you may get a splinter in your eye from all the scenery being chewed.a nut is holding her hostage , children are outside the open screen , so she whimpers for help instead of screaming when only a moment ago she was brave enough to be smashing windows to yell to these same children.she 's finally free and alone in the house .
her chance to go for help , so what does she do ?
wanders around the house and lies down .
she 's in the basement , locked away .
so what does she do ?
takes a little nap .
come on !
most of the movie is the nut wandering away and finding her sitting there snoozing when he wakes her up .
four times !
what ?
if the writer is too bored to actually write a real plot why should we be paying attention ?
i think the key here is that it was originally a play for the radio , so they filled in with the heroine just sitting around rather than pretending to be screen writers and actually writing any action.and the ending is horrendous.the whole movie is completely implausible , horribly written and almost comically acted .
beware this movie at all costs !
