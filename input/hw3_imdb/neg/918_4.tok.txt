this experimental silent film , made in switzerland by an independent british film company , is chiefly remembered as paul robeson 's first film .
it 's very artistic , with shots often seeming meaningless to the story , which is difficult to understand anyway because of the lack of enough inter-titles .
from what i gathered , robeson 's wife , adah , is in an inter-racial love affair with a white man called thorne .
it does n't bother the cigar-chomping owner of the bar/hotel where thorne lives ( and she seems to be having a lesbian relationship with a barmaid ) , but an old lady expresses the town 's point of view in an inter-title : `` if i had my way , we would n't allow negroes in here . ''
thorne is also called `` nigger lover '' by someone in the bar .
adah tries a reconciliation with pete ( robeson ) , but eventually leaves him .
thorne 's wife , astrid , goes off the deep end , brandishes a knife , cuts thorne 's arm and cheek , and somehow dies .
thorne must have been accused of murder because we learn he was acquitted .
as for pete , he gets a letter from the mayor telling him it is best for everyone that he leave town .
so the film is more about racism than anything , but in an up note , the owner tells pete `` the sad thing is , they think they 're right .
that 's the way we are . ''
the meaning of the title is a mystery .
it may refer to adah being light-skinned ( a borderline negro ) or to the borderline behavior of of the main characters .
