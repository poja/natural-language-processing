tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter do n't care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something .
weird locations , too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary .
sex does not always sell when you are selling to women .
the same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural .
people come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show .
my daughter has a 36 '' inseam , is tall & slender & a size 5 , i am more average at a size 12. we would like to see both- i can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it , it will not fit the same way on me .
i do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter .
we would really love the show to consider women of all sizes .
thank you .
