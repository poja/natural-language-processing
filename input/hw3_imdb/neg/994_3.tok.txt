this is a poor excuse for a movie .
a film noir done by busbee berkeley ?
please !
first , let 's forget about the plot , a truly simple-minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde .
yechh .
so what turns her from despising him to loving him ?
along with a group of other guys , he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is siphoned off , stranding them .
it is n't exactly heroics , but she 's suddenly smitten .
it 's truly painful to watch claude rains trying to portray a hard-bitten , tough-talking , noir-type cop .
a crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool , along with a growling voice .
most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles .
how he ever got talked into taking this job i 'll never understand .
enjoy it , if you can , for a few period details , the old cars and gas pumps , but do n't expect a decent film experience .
it wasted 1-1/12 hours of my life .
