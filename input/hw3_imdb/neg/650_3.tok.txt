i really wanted to like this movie , but the pacing was just way too slow.it was a nice story , but it was really like watching a slug race.the movie would have been better served , if it had some more action .
i do n't mean anything grand , but at least something in the background.it could have also been helped by songs that set the tone/mood of the more lengthy periods that were absent of dialogue.it 's been about 10 years since i 've seen it , so i may have to give it another chance.3/10 or *1/2 ( out of four )
