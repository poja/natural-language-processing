this movie is a cinematic collage of gangster clich√©s .
the writing is grade z and the plot and story are constructed without care or logic .
it a messy pastiche of stereotypical gangsters ( think of bugs bunny cartoons ) and silly supporting characters ( the lady doctor and the writer ) .
there are much better bogart films out there .
in fact , bogart looks like he slept through this performance .
he puts very little effort into this character .
i think the directorial advice he received was something like `` he 's a bad guy .
act bad '' .
this guy is the era 's equivalent of darth vader ; obvious , evil and the anti-hero .
do n't waste your time with this one .
