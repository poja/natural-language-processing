one of those movies in which there are no big twists whatsoever and you can predict pretty much whats is going to happen .
matt dillon was awesome once again , but the rest did n't played a bigger part as they should have.it was exciting in the beginning but kinda slow paced and predictable in the end.its one of those flicks in which the good guy wins no matter happens.if you have absolutely nothing to do , you can give it a try i personally found it not worth watching .
the story could have been more interesting and the director could have made it less of a b-movie by engineering a happy ending .
