i was wondering what possessed the organizers of the victoria film festival to include this film in their program .
i guess they must have agreed with the others who have reviewed this film .
i , on the other hand , consider it the worst film i have ever seen .
it starts with a bad script , full of holes , and dialog so unlikely it 's embarrassing .
ideas are introduced , then dropped with no development .
the acting left me totally cold and uninvolved .
the set decoration was appropriate for the time , but a decorator 's nightmare .
the only way the characters could love this house is if their previous homes had been ghastly .
the attic looked as if the items had been thrown in for the scene with no attempt to create the look of a real attic that has been filling with junk over the years .
the photography was leaden and lacking in variety .
save your money for something worthwhile .
