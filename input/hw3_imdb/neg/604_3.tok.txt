to sum it up in a nutshell , this film was disappointing and could have been shortened by twenty minutes.the acting was sub-par , the only decent actors of the bunch being trisha , the killer and molly .
the music was slightly lame but fitting and the special effects were much too overused .
the story/scriptwriting was poor , the unnecessary torture/romantic scenes being dragged on for way too long and a disappointing ending.the start of the film was rather slow , the fake-looking gore not much of interest .
trisha arrived at the house , and there was some premise for a good storyline.trisha started to receive the threatening phone calls , which heightened the suspense .
this momentary suspense , the best feature of the movie began to build , but then the friends crashed the place , wrecking all potential suspense/horror in the film.the plot then becomes obtuse from here on .
chemistry sparks between the two couples , and then the killer picks off frank and the other girl .
this scene was dragged on and unnecessary.the killer then makes her way for trisha and ties her up .
there is an overdone torture scene which goes on for at least ten minutes too long .
as the gore is done badly this is not entertaining at all , and it bores more than shocks.in summary , the first thirty minutes of this film sound promising but then poorly written dialogue and general lack of plot ruins this film.3/10 .
