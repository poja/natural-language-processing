this movie had horrible lighting and terrible camera movements .
this movie is a jumpy horror flick with no meaning at all .
the slashes are totally fake looking .
it looks like some 17 year-old idiot wrote this movie and a 10 year old kid shot it .
with the worst acting you can ever find .
people are tired of knives .
at least move on to guns or fire .
it has almost exact lines from `` when a stranger calls '' .
with gruesome killings , only crazy people would enjoy this movie .
it is obvious the writer does n't have kids or even care for them .
i mean at show some mercy .
just to sum it up , this movie is a `` b '' movie and it sucked .
just for your own sake , do n't even think about wasting your time watching this crappy movie .
