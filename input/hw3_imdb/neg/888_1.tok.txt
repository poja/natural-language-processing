i 've seen a lot of bad movies in my life .
date movie .
that was bad .
but this ... this is just ... it 's not good .
house party 4 is the worst movie ever .
it 's as simple as that .
it 's basically ferris bueller with black people in it .
oh , and it 's not funny .
it 's awful .
so awful .
chris stokes may be a superstar on bet , but he 's an idiot .
he ca n't write a comedy .
or a horror movie .
i like to refer to him as a blacker , lesser-known uwe boll .
except uwe boll 's films are funny awful , if you know what i mean .
you can invite some buddies over , pop in alone in the dark , and have a great time laughing and eating snacks with your buddies .
chris stokes is like that , except if you invite friends over to watch house party 4 with you , no one will be laughing .
not even the biased token black guy or the illiterate jock .
i 'm serious , i did n't laugh once throughout this whole movie .
the acting is terrible , and the movie looks like a bad indie film .
what was the budget for this movie ?
5 damn dollars ?
i mean , what the hell ?
this movie just sucks ; do n't waste your time with this crap .
it 's disgusting .
