the sounds in the movie were so mundane and ridiculous , seriously banging on the door hinges for about 30 minutes really crunches your teeth and makes your head hurt.i love bad puns more than the next guy , but come on `` no blood on our hands '' being said about a million times by matt dillon ' character , and when matt dillon 's character shoots the bum the lead character which i fail to remember his name because i do n't really think anyone cares gets blood on his hands literally.the background music with the heavy metal guitar ringing an a-chord for about 5 minutes is n't my idea of music , come on i was having the worst headache by the end of this garbage .
