i just do n't get it .
why call this a sequel to the film `` american werewolf '' when it has absolutely no connection with it whatsoever ?
the first film was funny *and* scary with ground breaking special effects .
( if memory serves , the oscar category for special make-up effects was *created* for this movie ) .
`` paris '' is none of these things .
awful effects , and not much else .
do not see this movie .
rent the original `` werewolf in london '' instead .
you 'll be much happier .
