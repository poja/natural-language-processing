maybe if you smoked enough weed this would seem funny or would make you nostalgic for how completely unhinged people allowed themselves to be in the early 70 's .
there 's an odd innocence to this movie and the sex is a lot more awkward and playful than the steely pros who do it for the cameras now.the real curio here - and really the only reason to watch this movie - is the appearance of kristine debell as alice .
she was a ford model and it shows .
she 's got classic , wasp-ish good looks - like a really cute ivy league sorority girl .
so what the hell is she doing in this cheap , cheesy skin flick ?
from my vantage point she does not appear to be at all on drugs in this movie ( which might explain it ) and she actually seems incredibly committed to the part .
when she sings her first song she really does act like she thinks she 's flippin ' julie andrews or something .
i just get the feeling that this girl truly believed this was gon na be her big break or something , instead of the near career killer that it was .
anyway , she is damn cute and you kind of ca n't believe she would even get naked on screen , much less do a masturbation scene , a couple of oral sex scenes ( with men and women ) and then do the real deal as a climax to the film ( snark ) .
it is also definitely not a body double at all .
that is our little kristine taking one for the team , or for the greater glory of showbiz or something .
it 's pretty amazing to watch and it is definitely stimulating ( ahem ) but in a way i kinda wish she had n't done it .
that was a very pretty , talented young girl getting some really bad advice.anyway , my guess is that kristine debell , wherever she is , has long , long since wished this movie would go away .
she was very cute and appealing in `` meatballs . ''
almost impossible to believe this is the same girl - but it is .
