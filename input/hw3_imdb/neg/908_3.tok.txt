the movie uses motifs that could be plagiarized from `` wait until dark '' ( 1967 ) , a much better movie by terence young , starring audrey hepburn .
`` dead silent '' is a pale paraphrase .
there is nothing new here -- the hidden object in the doll , the bad men wanting it , the bad guy posing as a good guy .
the disability , though , has shifted : audrey hepburn could n't see , the child in ds can not speak .
but both stories hinge on the handicap .
where `` wait until dark '' built up unbearable suspense , `` dead silent '' lets you guess the outcome , the story being such a stereotype .
