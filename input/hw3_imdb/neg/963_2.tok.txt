danger : watch for falling spoilers ... boy , was this a bad movie .
i know that they were going for a `` true love conquers all '' kind of thing , but about all this film conquered was about 3 ( which felt more like 9 ) hours of my afternoon which i will never get back .
the movie is about two young lovers named kai and gerta who live in a remote town in a fantasy world .
kai is the much-abused bellboy at a hotel owned by gerta 's father .
at first gerta ignores kai 's advances but she eventually warms up to him much to the disgust of ( you guessed it ! )
gerta 's father .
as if this obstacle was n't enough to overcome , an evil snow queen shoots a shard of glass in kai 's eye and he becomes a mean person treats gerta poorly .
kai is eventually taken to the snow queen 's fortress ( which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice , because the good people at hallmark like to go all out ) and gerta sets out on a mission to get kai back .
along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way , but gerta escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way .
( all the while you will want to turn it off , but ca n't force yourself to do it .
it 's probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the snow queen ) anyways , i will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it .
so , in conclusion , the snow queen is an incredibly boring movie , which takes the fan out of fantasy .
