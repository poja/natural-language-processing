i 'm in a film class and i know that i do n't know everything about film but truthfully this is one of the worst , stupidest , retarded and waste time , movies that i have ever seen and i saw napolean dinamite .
they are both equally terrible .
conrack is boring and nothing interesting even happens in the film its not really a heart warming story and pat conroy overcomes nothing !
i 'm not saying there should be fighting and crap blowing up but it would liven up this more than bland film .
the kids they fond to act in this film may have been the real kids from yammacraux island they sounded stupid and could n't act as as far as i am concerned this was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idea for a movie i do n't know why this movie was even made , deviantly top five worst movies of all time .
