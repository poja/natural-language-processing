first , let me start by saying that i am a laurel and hardy buff .
i have read every book printed about them , and have seen all of their available films more than once .
i even took a chance once , and called stan on the telephone .
he was very kind , and spoke with me for over ten minutes .
i followed with a letter , and he wrote me a letter back .
i still have that letter.this film has some fine comedy moments , but stan and ollie are not up to their usual form .
stan was gravely ill during the production and looked worse than he did ten years later .
in my opinion , any laurel and hardy film is worth seeing.but the ultimate opinion of this film comes from the great stan laurel himself .
to quote him , `` this film should never have been made . ''
