of all of the post-1985 perry mason movies i have seen , this one is my least favorite.i confess i have never liked diana muldaur as an actress .
she only seems to know how to play one type of character - a hard-bitten career woman with some undefined chip on her shoulder who for that reason is extremely difficult to in any way sympathize with .
this one is no exception - it runs true to form.the only thing that saves this movie , in my opinion , is an earnest performance by scott baio as the prosecutor - i actually found myself rooting for him to win , and the movie is worth seeing for him alone .
